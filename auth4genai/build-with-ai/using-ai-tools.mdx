description: Use AI tools to integrate Auth0 for AI Agents into your application.

## Introduction
Building with AI tools that have information and context about Auth0 for AI Agents enables you to accelerate your development workflows. By providing these tools with the right information, you can get instant, context-aware answers and even delegate tasks to AI agents.

This allows you to:

- Ask questions in natural language to get up-to-date answers on how to set up and integrate with Auth0 for AI Agents.
- Generate accurate code snippets and get direct links to relevant documentation to help you implement changes faster.
- Have AI agents read documentation to understand complex requirements and apply them to your codebase.

## How it works
### LLM context files
You can provide your AI with targeted information from raw text files (`llms.txt`), individual markdown pages, or URLs to help it perform a specific task. To enable your AI tools to index and search the documentation, use the following files:

- For a high-level overview, the **llms.txt** file at `https://auth0.com/ai/docs/llms.txt` offers concise summaries of all our documentation pages.
- If you need the complete content, you can use the **llms-full.txt** file at `https://auth0.com/ai/docs/llms-full.txt`, which contains the full content of our documentation in a single file.
- Additionally, you can get a **markdown** version of any individual page. Click **Copy page** at the top of the page or append `.md` to any page URL.

We recommend using the Auth0 for AI Agents MCP Server over context files to ensure your AI tools always have access to the most up-to-date information.

### MCP servers
A more powerful method is connecting your tool to an MCP server. These servers act like a specialized API for your AI, allowing them to search for and read documents or perform actions on your behalf.

### Auth0 MCP Server
The Auth0 MCP Server allows authenticated AI agents to perform actions in your Auth0 tenant, such as creating applications, configuring connections, and more. To learn how to connect your AI tool to the Auth0 MCP Server, read the [Auth0 MCP Server documentation.](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-mcp-server)

### Auth0 for AI Agents MCP Server
The Auth0 for AI Agents MCP Server provides read-only access to our complete documentation. Use this server to ask questions and get context-aware answers about integrating with Auth0 for AI Agents. This MCP server helps your AI tools implement the Auth0 for AI Agents functionality.

The Auth0 for AI Agents MCP Server has the following endpoint metadata:

- **Server Name:** Auth0 for AI Agents
- **Server URL:** `https://auth0.com/ai/docs/mcp`
- **Transport Type:** HTTP

You can also connect your AI tool to the Auth0 for AI Agents MCP Server by following one of our guides.

## How to use the Auth0 for AI Agents Docs MCP server
After adding the MCP server to your AI tool, you can ask it questions about how to set up, configure, or integrate with Auth0 for AI Agents. AI coding agents will be able to automatically retrieve the matching documentation for steps, references, and examples when applying code changes. 

### Sample prompts
Use these sample prompts to get a quick response, start building a new app, or integrate functionality into your existing app:

- Use the Auth0 for AI Agents MCP server to tell me about accessing 3rd party APIs using a user's credentials.
- Add a tool call to my AI agent that will access the user's Google calendar and answer questions about their schedule and meetings. Use the Auth0 for AI Agents MCP Server to find and follow the instructions on using Auth0 to securely call the Google API using the user's credentials.
- Build me a Next.js AI chatbot app that uses Langgraph to make tool calls to Google Calendar. Use Auth0 for user login and to secure the tool calls to the user's calendar. Use the Auth0 for AI Agents MCP Server for instructions.

<Note>Even with access to the most up-to-date documentation, AI tools can make mistakes. Always review AI-generated code for accuracy.</Note>
