### Install dependencies

In the root directory of your project, install the following dependencies:

- `@auth0/ai-vercel`: [Auth0 AI SDK for Vercel AI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-ai-js/tree/main/packages/ai-vercel) built for AI agents powered by the Vercel AI SDK.
- `ai`: Core [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) module that interacts with various AI model providers.
- `@ai-sdk/openai`: [OpenAI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai) provider for the Vercel AI SDK.
- `@ai-sdk/react`: [React](https://react.dev/) UI components for the Vercel AI SDK.
- `zod`: TypeScript-first schema validation library.

```bash wrap lines
npm install @auth0/ai-vercel@4 ai@5.0.33 @ai-sdk/openai@2.0.24 @ai-sdk/react@2.0.33 zod@3.25.76
```

### Update the environment file

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and update the variables with your Auth0 credentials. You can find your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret in the application you created in the Auth0 Dashboard.

### Set up Human-in-the-Loop approvals

Integrate the Auth0 AI SDK into your application to secure your async AI agent workflow. For this quickstart, we will use a blocking request flow. In real use cases, often an asynchronous flow is preferred.

#### Configure the Auth0 AI SDK

To require asynchronous authorization for your tool, the tool needs to be wrapped with the Async authorizer, `withAsyncAuthorization()`. Let's create a helper function to wrap the tool with the Async authorizer.

Create a file at `src/lib/auth0-ai.ts` and instantiate a new Auth0 AI SDK client:

```tsx src/lib/auth0-ai.ts wrap lines
import { Auth0AI } from "@auth0/ai-vercel";
import { AccessDeniedInterrupt } from "@auth0/ai/interrupts";

import { getUser } from "./auth0";

const auth0AI = new Auth0AI();

// Async Authorization flow for user confirmation
export const withAsyncAuthorization = auth0AI.withAsyncAuthorization({
  userID: async () => {
    const user = await getUser();
    return user?.sub as string;
  },
  bindingMessage: async ({ product, qty }) =>
    `Do you want to buy ${qty} ${product}`,
  scopes: ["openid", "product:buy"], // add any scopes you want to use with your API
  audience: process.env["SHOP_API_AUDIENCE"]!,

  /**
   * Note: Setting a requested expiry greater than 300 (seconds) will force email verification
   * instead of using the push notification flow.
   */
  // requestedExpiry: 301,

  /**
   * The behavior when the authorization request is made.
   *
   * - `block`: The tool execution is blocked until the user completes the authorization.
   * - `interrupt`: The tool execution is interrupted until the user completes the authorization.
   * - a callback: Same as "block" but give access to the auth request and executing logic.
   *
   * Defaults to `interrupt`.
   *
   * When this flag is set to `block`, the execution of the tool awaits
   * until the user approves or rejects the request.
   * Given the asynchronous nature of the CIBA flow, this mode
   * is only useful during development.
   *
   * In practice, the process that is awaiting the user confirmation
   * could crash or timeout before the user approves the request.
   */
  onAuthorizationRequest: async (authReq, creds) => {
    console.log(`An authorization request was sent to your mobile device or your email.`);
    await creds;
    console.log(`Thanks for approving the order.`);
  },

  onUnauthorized: async (e: Error) => {
    if (e instanceof AccessDeniedInterrupt) {
      return "The user has denied the request";
    }
    return e.message;
  },
});
```

This will intercept the tool call to initiate a CIBA request:

- The CIBA request includes the user ID that will approve the request.
- Auth0 sends the user a mobile push notification. The AI agent polls the `/token` endpoint for a user response.
- The mobile application retrieves the `bindingMessage` containing the consent details, in this case, the details of the product to purchase.
- The user responds to the request:
  - If the request is approved, the tool execution will continue.
  - If the request is rejected, the tool execution will not continue.

</Frame>

Next, add the following code to `src/lib/auth0.ts`:

```tsx src/lib/auth0.ts wrap lines highlight={2-5}
//... existing code
export const getUser = async () => {
  const session = await auth0.getSession();
  return session?.user;
};
```

#### Require async authorization for your tool

In this example, we wrap a tool that buys products on the user's behalf. When the user approves the transaction, the Auth0 AI SDK retrieves an access token to call the shop's API. Upon completing the CIBA flow, the AI agent responds with a message confirming the purchase.

The Auth0 AI SDK returns an error response if the user denies the transaction.

Now, create and wrap the tool with the Async authorizer. Create a file `src/lib/tools/shop-online.ts` and add the following code:

```ts src/lib/tools/shop-online.ts wrap lines
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

import { getAsyncAuthorizationCredentials } from "@auth0/ai-vercel";
import { withAsyncAuthorization } from "../auth0-ai";

export const shopOnlineTool = withAsyncAuthorization(
  tool({
    description: "Tool to buy products online",
    parameters: z.object({
      product: z.string(),
      qty: z.number(),
      priceLimit: z.number().optional(),
    }),
    execute: async ({ product, qty, priceLimit }) => {
      console.log(`Ordering ${qty} ${product} with price limit ${priceLimit}`);

      const apiUrl = process.env["SHOP_API_URL"]!;

      if (!apiUrl) {
        // No API set, mock a response or return error
        return `Ordered ${qty} ${product}`;
      }

      const headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: "",
      };
      const body = {
        product,
        qty,
        priceLimit,
      };

      const credentials = getAsyncAuthorizationCredentials();
      const accessToken = credentials?.accessToken;

      if (accessToken) {
        headers["Authorization"] = "Bearer " + accessToken;
      }

      const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: headers,
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
      });

      return response.statusText;
    },
  })
);
```

### Update environment variables

You need to [obtain an API Key from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or another provider to use an LLM.

If you want to use an API, it must be [registered with Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis) and have a valid audience.

Update the `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash .env.local wrap lines
# ... existing variables
# You can use any provider of your choice supported by Vercel AI
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

# API (OPTIONAL)
SHOP_API_URL=<your-shop-api-url>
SHOP_API_AUDIENCE=sample-shop-api
```

### Integrate the tool into an AI agent

Call the tool from your AI app to make purchases. Update the `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` file with the following code:

```ts src/app/api/chat/route.ts wrap lines highlight={2,3,11,13}
//...
import { setAIContext } from "@auth0/ai-vercel";
import { shopOnlineTool } from "@/lib/tools/shop-online";

//...
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { id, messages }: { id: string; messages: Array<UIMessage> } = await req.json();

  const tools = { shopOnlineTool };

  setAIContext({ threadID: id });

  const stream = createUIMessageStream({
    async execute({ writer }) {
      const result = streamText({
        model: openai.chat('gpt-4o-mini'),
        system: AGENT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE,
        messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
        tools,
      });

      writer.merge(
        result.toUIMessageStream({
          sendReasoning: true,
        }),
      );
    },
  });

  return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
}
//...
```

### Test the application

Start the application with `npm run dev`. Then, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

You can ask the AI agent to buy a product, for example, "Buy an XYZ phone." Now, look for a push notification from the [Auth0 Guardian app](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/auth0-guardian/user-enrollment) or your custom app integrated with the [Auth0 Guardian SDK](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/auth0-guardian) on your mobile device. Once you approve the notification, you should see the tool being executed and a response from the agent.

Explore the [example app on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples/tree/main/async-authorization/vercel-ai-next-js).
