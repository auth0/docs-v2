## Follow manual steps

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Clone sample app">
      Clone this sample app from the [Auth0 AI samples](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples) repository:

      ```bash wrap lines
      git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples.git
      cd auth0-ai-samples/authenticate-users/langchain-fastapi-py
      ```

      The project is divided into these two folders:

      - `backend`: contains the backend code for the web application, an API written in Python using FastAPI and the LangGraph agent.
      - `frontend`: contains the frontend code for the web application written in React as a Vite Single Page App (SPA).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install backend packages">
      In the `backend` directory of your project, install the required packages using your preferred package manager, such as `uv`. You can follow the instructions to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) in its documentation.

      ```bash wrap lines
      cd backend
      uv sync
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your environment file">
In the `backend` directory of your project, create a new file and name it `.env` and add the following content:

```bash .env wrap lines
APP_BASE_URL='http://localhost:8000'
AUTH0_SECRET='random 32 byte value'
AUTH0_DOMAIN='<your-auth0-domain>'
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='<your-auth0-application-client-id>'
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='<your-auth0-application-client-secret>'
```
Access your `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` by viewing the Auth0 Application that you created in the Auth0 Dashboard and navigating to the Basic Information section at the top of the Settings tab.
Copy each value to the matching setting.

Next, run this command to generate a random 32 byte value and copy it to the `AUTH0_SECRET` field.
```bash generate random 32 byte value
openssl rand -hex 32
```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install frontend packages">
Ensure you have `npm` installed or follow the instructions here to [install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
Navigate to the `frontend` directory of your project and install the required packages:

```bash wrap lines
cd frontend
npm install
```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your application">
To run your application, start both the FastAPI backend and the frontend in two terminals:

1. In one terminal, start the FastAPI backend:

```bash wrap lines
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

2. In a second new terminal, start the frontend:

```bash wrap lines
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Visit the URL `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

You will see:

  src="/img/signup_dark.png"
  alt="Auth0 login screen"
/>
</Frame>

Sign up to your application to create a new user account. You will then see a welcome message with your user name. You can sign in with that account on future visits.
