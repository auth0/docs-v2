### Install dependencies

In the root directory of your project, install the following dependencies:

- `@auth0/ai-langchain`: [Auth0 AI SDK for LangChain](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-ai-js/tree/main/packages/ai-langchain) built for AI agents powered by LangChain.
- `@langchain/langgraph`: For building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- `langchain`: The LangChain library.
- `@langchain/core`: LangChain core libraries.
- `@langchain/openai`: OpenAI provider for LangChain.
- `langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough`: API passthrough for LangGraph.

```bash wrap lines
npm install @auth0/ai-langchain@4 @langchain/core@0.3.77 @langchain/langgraph@0.4.9 @langchain/openai@0.6.13 langchain@0.3.33 langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough@0.1.4
```
### Update the environment file

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and update the variables with your Auth0 credentials. You can find your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret in the application you created in the Auth0 Dashboard.

### Set up Human-in-the-Loop approvals

Integrate the Auth0 AI SDK into your application to secure your async AI agent workflow. For this quickstart, we will use a blocking request flow. In real use cases, often an asynchronous flow is preferred.

#### Configure the Auth0 AI SDK

To require asynchronous authorization for your tool, the tool needs to be wrapped with the Async authorizer, `withAsyncAuthorization()`. Let's create a helper function to wrap the tool with the Async authorizer.

Create a file at `src/lib/auth0-ai.ts` and instantiate a new Auth0 AI SDK client:

```tsx src/lib/auth0-ai.ts wrap lines
import { Auth0AI } from "@auth0/ai-langchain";
import { AccessDeniedInterrupt } from "@auth0/ai/interrupts";

const auth0AI = new Auth0AI();

// Async Authorization flow for user confirmation
export const withAsyncAuthorization = auth0AI.withAsyncAuthorization({
  userID: async (_params, config) => {
    return config.configurable?.langgraph_auth_user?.sub;
  },
  bindingMessage: async ({ product, qty }) =>
    `Do you want to buy ${qty} ${product}`,
  scopes: ["openid", "product:buy"], // add any scopes you want to use with your API
  audience: process.env["SHOP_API_AUDIENCE"]!,

  /**
   * Controls how long the authorization request is valid for.
   */
  // requestedExpiry: 301,

  /**
   * The behavior when the authorization request is made.
   *
   * - `block`: The tool execution is blocked until the user completes the authorization.
   * - `interrupt`: The tool execution is interrupted until the user completes the authorization.
   * - a callback: Same as "block" but give access to the auth request and executing logic.
   *
   * Defaults to `interrupt`.
   *
   * When this flag is set to `block`, the execution of the tool awaits
   * until the user approves or rejects the request.
   * Given the asynchronous nature of the CIBA flow, this mode
   * is only useful during development.
   *
   * In practice, the process that is awaiting the user confirmation
   * could crash or timeout before the user approves the request.
   */
  onAuthorizationRequest: async (authReq, creds) => {
    console.log(`An authorization request was sent to your mobile device.`);
    await creds;
    console.log(`Thanks for approving the order.`);
  },

  onUnauthorized: async (e: Error) => {
    if (e instanceof AccessDeniedInterrupt) {
      return "The user has denied the request";
    }
    return e.message;
  },
});
```

This will intercept the tool call to initiate a Async Authorization request:

- The Async Authorization request includes the user ID that will approve the request.
- Auth0 sends the user a mobile push notification. The AI agent polls the `/token` endpoint for a user response.
- The mobile application retrieves the `bindingMessage` containing the consent details, in this case, the details of the product to purchase.
- The user responds to the request:
  - If the request is approved, the tool execution will continue.
  - If the request is rejected, the tool execution will not continue.

#### Pass credentials to the tools

Next, add the following code to `src/lib/auth0.ts`:

```tsx src/lib/auth0.ts wrap lines highlight={12-20}
//... existing code
export const auth0 = new Auth0Client({
  authorizationParameters: {
    // In v4, the AUTH0_SCOPE and AUTH0_AUDIENCE environment variables are no longer automatically picked up by the SDK.
    // Instead, we need to provide the values explicitly.
    scope: process.env.AUTH0_SCOPE,
    audience: process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
  },
});

// Get the Access token from Auth0 session
export const getAccessToken = async () => {
  const tokenResult = await auth0.getAccessToken();

  if(!tokenResult || !tokenResult.token) {
    throw new Error("No access token found in Auth0 session");
  }

  return tokenResult.token;
};
```

Update the `/src/app/api/chat/[..._path]/route.ts` file with the following code. The access token will be passed to your LangGraph agent so we can use it from the Auth0 AI SDK to get the current user.

```ts src/app/api/chat/[..._path]/route.ts wrap lines highlight={3,9-13}
import { initApiPassthrough } from "langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough";

import { getAccessToken } from "@/lib/auth0";

export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, runtime } =
  initApiPassthrough({
    apiUrl: process.env.LANGGRAPH_API_URL,
    baseRoute: "chat/",
    headers: async () => {
      const accessToken = await getAccessToken();
      return {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      };
  });
```

### Add Custom Authentication
<Info>
For more information on how to add custom authentication for your LangGraph Platform application, read the [Custom Auth](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/auth/custom_auth/) guide.
</Info>
In your `langgraph.json`, add the path to your auth file:
```typescript langgraph.json wrap lines highlight={8}
{
  "node_version": "20",
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./src/lib/agent.ts:agent"
  },
  "env": ".env",
  "auth": {
    "path": "./src/lib/auth.ts:authHandler"
  }
}
```
Then, in your auth.ts file, add your auth logic:
```typescript src/lib/auth.ts wrap lines
import { createRemoteJWKSet, jwtVerify } from "jose";

const { Auth, HTTPException } = require("@langchain/langgraph-sdk/auth");

const AUTH0_DOMAIN = process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN;
const AUTH0_AUDIENCE = process.env.AUTH0_AUDIENCE;

// JWKS endpoint for Auth0
const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(
  new URL(`https://${AUTH0_DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`)
);

// Create the Auth instance
const auth = new Auth();
// Register the authentication handler
auth.authenticate(async (request: Request) => {
  const authHeader = request.headers.get("Authorization");
  const xApiKeyHeader = request.headers.get("x-api-key");
    /**
     * LangGraph Platform will convert the `Authorization` header from the client to an `x-api-key` header automatically
     * as of now: https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/custom-auth
     *
     * We can still leverage the `Authorization` header when served in other infrastructure w/ langgraph-cli
     * or when running locally.
     */
    // This header is required in Langgraph Cloud.
    if (!authHeader && !xApiKeyHeader) {
      throw new HTTPException(401, {
        message: "Invalid auth header provided.",
      });
    }

    // prefer the xApiKeyHeader first
    let token = xApiKeyHeader || authHeader;

    // Remove "Bearer " prefix if present
    if (token && token.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
      token = token.substring(7);
    }

    // Validate Auth0 Access Token using common JWKS endpoint
    if (!token) {
      throw new HTTPException(401, {
        message:
          "Authorization header format must be of the form: Bearer <token>",
      });
    }

    if (token) {
      try {
        // Verify the JWT using Auth0 JWKS
        const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
          issuer: `https://${AUTH0_DOMAIN}/`,
          audience: AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
        });

        console.log("âœ… Auth0 JWT payload resolved!", payload);

        // Return the verified payload - this becomes available in graph nodes
        return {
          identity: payload.sub!,
          email: payload.email as string,
          permissions:
            typeof payload.scope === "string" ? payload.scope.split(" ") : [],
          auth_type: "auth0",
          // include the access token for use with Auth0 Token Vault exchanges by tools
          getRawAccessToken: () => token,
          // Add any other claims you need
          ...payload,
        };
      } catch (jwtError) {
        console.log(
          "Auth0 JWT validation failed:",
          jwtError instanceof Error ? jwtError.message : "Unknown error"
        );
        throw new HTTPException(401, {
          message: "Invalid Authorization token provided.",
        });
      }
    }
});

export { auth as authHandler };
```

#### Create a tool to call your API

In this example, we use a tool that buys products on the user's behalf. When the user approves the transaction, the Auth0 AI SDK retrieves an access token to call the shop's API. Upon completing the Async Authorization flow, the AI agent responds with a message confirming the purchase. The Auth0 AI SDK returns an error response if the user denies the transaction.

Now, create a file `src/lib/tools/shop-online.ts` and add the following code:

```ts src/lib/tools/shop-online.ts wrap lines
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

import { getAsyncAuthorizationCredentials } from "@auth0/ai-langchain";

export const shopOnlineTool = tool(
  async ({ product, qty, priceLimit }) => {
    console.log(`Ordering ${qty} ${product} with price limit ${priceLimit}`);

    const apiUrl = process.env["SHOP_API_URL"]!;

    if (!apiUrl) {
      // No API set, mock a response
      return `Ordered ${qty} ${product}`;
    }

    const headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "",
    };
    const body = {
      product,
      qty,
      priceLimit,
    };

    const credentials = getAsyncAuthorizationCredentials();
    const accessToken = credentials?.accessToken;

    if (accessToken) {
      headers["Authorization"] = "Bearer " + accessToken;
    }

    const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: headers,
      body: JSON.stringify(body),
    });

    return response.statusText;
  },
  {
    name: "shop_online",
    description: "Tool to buy products online",
    schema: z.object({
      product: z.string(),
      qty: z.number(),
      priceLimit: z.number().optional(),
    }),
  }
);
```

### Update environment variables

You need to [obtain an API Key from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or another provider to use an LLM.

If you want to use an API, it must be [registered with Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis) and have a valid audience.

Update the `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash .env.local wrap lines
# ... existing variables
# You can use any provider of your choice supported by AI SDK
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

# API
SHOP_API_URL=<your-shop-api-url>
SHOP_API_AUDIENCE=sample-shop-api
```

### Require async authorization for your tool

Call the tool from your AI app to make purchases. Update the `src/lib/agent.ts` file with the following code:

```ts src/lib/agent.ts wrap lines highlight={2,3,9}
//...
import { withAsyncAuthorization } from "./auth0-ai";
import { shopOnlineTool } from "./tools/shop-online";

//... existing code

const tools = [
  //... existing tools
  withAsyncAuthorization(shopOnlineTool),
];

//... existing code
```

### Test the application

Start the application with `npm run all:dev`. Then, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

<Note>
  This will open the LangGraph Studio in a new tab. You can close it as we won't
  require it for testing the application.
</Note>

You can ask the AI agent to buy a product, for example, "Buy an XYZ phone." Now, look for a push notification from the [Auth0 Guardian app](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/auth0-guardian/user-enrollment) or your custom app integrated with the [Auth0 Guardian SDK](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/auth0-guardian) on your mobile device. Once you approve the notification, you should see the tool being executed and a response from the agent.

Explore the [example app on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples/tree/main/async-authorization/langchain-next-js).
