  <Accordion title="1. Promote the connection to a domain-level connection">
    To allow third-party clients like MCP Inspector to use a connection such as a username-and-password database or a social connection, you need to promote the connection to a domain-level connection. [Learn more about enabling third-party applications](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications/enable-third-party-applications).
    <Steps>
      <Step title="List Your Connection">
        List your connections to get their IDs
        ```shell
        auth0 api get connections
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choose Your Connections">
        From the list, identify which connections you want to use for the MCP server and copy the ID.
          * For the username-and-password database, look for the connection with the strategy `auth0`.
          * For the Google social connection, look for the connection with the strategy `google-oauth2`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Upgrade the Connection to Domain-Level">
        For each of those specific connection IDs, run the following command to mark it as a domain-level connection. Replace `YOUR_CONNECTION_ID` with the actual ID (e.g., `con_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`).

        ```shell wrap lines
        auth0 api patch connections/YOUR_CONNECTION_ID --data '{"is_domain_connection": true}'
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
