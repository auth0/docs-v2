You'll need an Auth0 FGA or OpenFGA store to manage fine-grained authorization for your MCP tools.

**Choose your FGA provider:**
- **Auth0 FGA**: Fully managed service at [fga.dev](https://fga.dev). Best for production use.
- **OpenFGA**: Self-hosted open-source option. Best for local development and testing.

<Note>
Both options use the same authorization model and API. You can start with OpenFGA locally and migrate to Auth0 FGA for production.
</Note>

The sample application includes a complete authorization model (`fga/model.fga`) and initial permission tuples (`fga/tuples.yaml`) that will be imported using the FGA CLI.
