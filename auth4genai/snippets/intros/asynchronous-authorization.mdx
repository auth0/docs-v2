This process relies on a decoupled authentication flow where the user provides consent on a trusted device, such as their mobile phone, separate from the device where the agent was initially engaged.

## Use cases for asynchronous authorization

AI agents often need to perform actions that are long-running, are executed at a later time, or involve sensitive operations. For example:

- **Transactional approvals:** An agent arranging a business trip might find a flight and hotel, but needs the user's final approval to complete the purchase.
- **Accessing sensitive data:** An agent might need to access a protected user's health records to answer a query.
- **Executing high-privilege tasks:** A DevOps agent might need permission to deploy a new version of an application to a production environment.

In these scenarios, the agent needs the user to approve an action at a later time. Asynchronous authorization allows the agent to initiate this request and let the user approve it at their convenience, creating a more seamless and secure user experience.

This decoupled mechanism is also ideal for human-in-the-loop interactions, such as approving a stock purchase through a chatbot or completing a financial transaction with a banking agent.
