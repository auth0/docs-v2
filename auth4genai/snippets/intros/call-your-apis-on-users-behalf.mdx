## Delegated authorization

The process relies on **delegated authorization**, where the user grants your AI application or AI agent permission to access protected resources without sharing their credentials directly. This is achieved through **access tokens:**. After a user authenticates, Auth0 issues an access token to your AI application. This token represents the user's consent and defines the scope of permissions granted.

### API on Auth0

An API is an entity that represents an external resource, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests made by applications. These APIs are configured to accept and validate access tokens. To protect an API, it must be [registered as an API](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis) using the Auth0 Dashboard.

## How it works for AI apps and agents

<Steps>
  <Step title="User authentication">
    A user logs into your AI application or agent interface (e.g., via Universal
    Login).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access token issuance">
    Upon successful authentication, an access token is issued to your
    application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI agent makes a tool call">
    When the AI agent needs to access user-specific data or perform an action,
    it makes a tool call to an API endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token forwarding">
    The access token obtained in step 2 is included in the API request
    (typically in the `Authorization` header).
  </Step>
  <Step title="API validation & response">
    The API validates the access token. If valid, it processes the request on
    behalf of the user and returns the response to the AI agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI agent receives and processes the information">
    The AI agent then uses this response to fulfill the user's request.
  </Step>
</Steps>
