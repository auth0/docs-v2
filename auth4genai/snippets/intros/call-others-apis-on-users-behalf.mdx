## Web applications with backend for frontend

In a typical scenario, a user interacts with a frontend application (e.g., a chatbot interface). This frontend communicates with a backend service, often a Backend for Frontend (BFF) or an agent, which is responsible for calling the external API.

By modeling your agent's backend as a secure application, it can obtain the necessary tokens from Token Vault to interact with external APIs while maintaining the user's context and permissions.
