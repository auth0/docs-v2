title: Authorization for RAG
description: "Authorization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ensures that when a GenAI application retrieves and uses your company's internal data to answer user questions, it only accesses information that the specific user is permitted to see. This prevents the AI model from inadvertently [exposing sensitive or confidential data](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm022025-sensitive-information-disclosure/) to unauthorized individuals."
