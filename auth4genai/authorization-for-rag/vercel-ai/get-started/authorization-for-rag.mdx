Auth for GenAI leverages [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization) to provide fine-grained authorization control for AI agents. As a result, when AI agents use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide sophisticated, relevant responses to user queries, they only have access to authorized data.

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an AI application that can:

1. Retrieve authorized data as context for a RAG pipeline.
2. Use Auth0 FGA to determine if the user has authorization for the data.
