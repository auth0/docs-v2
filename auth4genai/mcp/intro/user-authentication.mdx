Authenticate users before they or their AI Agents connect to MCP Servers. Auth0â€™s Universal Login supports social, enterprise, and custom identity providers so users can sign in with existing credentials. Every access token issued through Auth0 carries verified identity context, ensuring all MCP interactions start from a trusted source.

## Why authentication matters for MCP

* Secure and controlled access: Safeguards user data, manages who can use your MCP server and what they can do, and establishes a clear audit trail for activities performed through MCP servers and clients.  
* Auditability: Provides a record of user activities for auditing and compliance.

## Workforce Identity for MCP

Integrate your MCP environment with your enterprise identity provider using your **Workforce Single Sign-On (SSO)**. Auth0 connects to Okta, Entra ID, Ping, Google Workspace, and other IdPs so employees can authenticate with existing credentials before any MCP connection begins.

This pattern provides:

* Unified workforce authentication and MFA for MCP Servers  
* Centralized access policy enforcement and device posture checks  
* Consistent session context across all agent interactions

Workforce identity ensures that every request to an MCP Server originates from a verified employee identity governed by your enterprise security controls.
