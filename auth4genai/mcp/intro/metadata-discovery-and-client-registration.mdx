Register MCP clients and servers so AI Agents can safely connect to your resources using OAuth 2.0.

Auth0 automatically validates client metadata, issues unique credentials, and exposes standardized discovery endpoints for authorization: 

* Supports the `resource` parameter on `/authorize` and related endpoints to issue tokens scoped to specific APIs or MCP Servers

* Exposes the `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` document for automatic endpoint discovery

* Provides SDKs that manage registration, discovery, and token exchange for secure MCP integration

This pattern establishes trust between clients and APIs, limits access to approved agents, and provides secure, auditable registration for every MCP integration.

### Metadata Discovery

Metadata discovery is part of the authorization flow in MCP-powered applications. During the authorization process the MCP client will request the server information and the authorization server information should it exist (for details see [MCP Authorization Flow with Auth0](/mcp/core-concepts/core-concepts#mcp-authorization-flow-with-auth0)).

### Client Registration

After receiving the information about the MCP server and the authorization server the MCP client can be registered through either exchanging the client credentials or by performing Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

<Warning>
Auth0 supports [Open Dynamic Registration](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/dynamic-client-registration#enable-dynamic-client-registration), which means that if you enable this feature, anyone will be able to create applications in your tenant without a token.

## Authentication and Authorization for MCP Servers

When an MCP server is exposed to the internet, it must be secured. The MCP specification recommends using [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/) to secure these interactions. This allows an MCP server to delegate authentication to a dedicated authorization server and manage access control for different clients, users, and actions using scopes.

### Mandatory Server Configuration

For a client to interact with your server, the MCP specification requires you to announce your authorization configuration and use standard HTTP responses.

1. Announce Your Auth Server with Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))

   Your MCP server must tell clients where to get authorized. To do this, you must expose a metadata endpoint. Create a `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` endpoint on your server that returns a JSON object pointing to your Auth0 tenant. This allows MCP clients to automatically discover your authorization endpoints without manual configuration.

2. Use the `WWW-Authenticate` Header for 401 Errors

   When a client makes a request without a valid token, your server must return a `401 Unauthorized` status. Crucially, this response must include the `WWW-Authenticate` header, pointing to the metadata URL you configured above. This signals to the client that authentication is required and tells it exactly 

## Resource Parameter

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification requires the use of the standards-compliant `resource` parameter as defined in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html). If you want to use `resource` parameter on your applications you can enable it in the Auth0 Dashboard, follow the [Enable Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile guide](/mcp/guides/resource-param-compatibility-profile) to learn how.  

## MCP Authorization flow with Auth0

With Auth0 your MCP servers can follow OAuth 2.1 features required by the Model Context Protocol specification. [Learn more](/mcp/core-concepts#mcp-authorization-flow-with-auth0).

## Get started

To begin using Auth0 to protect your MCP server and leverage Auth0 for metadata discovery, refer to [Metadata Discovery and Client Registration](/mcp/get-started/metadata-discovery-and-client-registration) quickstart.
