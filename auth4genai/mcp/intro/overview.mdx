Auth0 for MCP extends the proven security of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), giving both enterprises and developers a safe foundation for connecting AI Agents to applications and APIs.

### User Authentication

Authenticate users before they or their AI Agents connect to MCP Servers. Auth0’s Universal Login supports social, enterprise, and custom identity providers so users can sign in with existing credentials. Every access token issued through Auth0 carries a verified identity context, ensuring all MCP interactions start from a trusted source.

For enterprise environments, **Workforce Identity for MCP** integrates your environment with your enterprise identity provider using **Single Sign-On (SSO)**. Auth0 connects to Okta, Entra ID, Ping, Google Workspace, and other IdPs so your employees can authenticate with existing credentials before any MCP connection begins.

### Metadata Discovery and Client Registration for MCP

Register MCP clients and servers so AI Agents can safely connect to your resources using OAuth 2.0. Auth0 automatically validates client metadata, issues unique credentials, and exposes standardized discovery endpoints for authorization, establishing trust between clients and APIs, limiting access to approved agents, and providing secure, auditable registration for every MCP integration.

### Call Your APIs on User’s Behalf

When an **AI Agent** connects to your **MCP server**, the server often needs to call your internal APIs to perform tasks for the user, like reading data or triggering workflows. These internal APIs require specific scoped credentials that reflect both who the user is and what the server is allowed to do.

**Auth0’s Custom Token Exchange** enables this secure delegation. The MCP server exchanges the token it received from the agent for a new, short-lived access token scoped to the internal API. Custom Token Exchange allows **MCP servers** to call internal APIs safely on behalf of users while **Auth0** issues and manages all access centrally.

### Call Third-Party APIs on a User’s behalf

MCP Servers often connect AI Agents to third-party services such as Google, Microsoft, Jira, or Notion. Auth0’s **Token Vault** handles these integrations by managing token issuance, storage, rotation, and revocation for external APIs. Token Vault eliminates manual credential handling and makes it easy to extend MCP connectivity across the modern SaaS ecosystem.
