title: Call Your APIs on User’s Behalf
description: Calling internal APIs on User's Behalf.
---

When an AI Agent connects to your MCP server, the server often needs to call your **own internal APIs** to perform tasks for the user such as reading data or triggering workflows. These internal APIs require specific, scoped credentials that reflect both who the user is and what the server is allowed to do on behalf of the user.

### Custom Token Exchange

Auth0's Custom Token Exchange gives you the added flexibility to set the user for the transaction by taking on the additional responsibility of securely validating the corresponding subject token that identifies the user for the transaction.

This pattern ensures that:

* Tokens are valid only for their intended resource  
* User context is preserved without exposing credentials  
* Internal APIs receive minimal, auditable permissions

Custom Token Exchange allows MCP Servers to call internal APIs safely on behalf of users while Auth0 issues and manages all access centrally.
