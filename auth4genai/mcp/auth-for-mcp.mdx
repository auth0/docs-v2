title: Auth for MCP Servers
description: For developers building applications that use AI agents to interact with external systems, standardizing how these agents call tools is a significant challenge. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a specification for this interaction. This guide gives a technical overview of MCP and explains how to implement robust authentication and authorization for MCP servers using Auth0.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

[MCP is an open standard](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), developed by Anthropic, that specifies a common interface for AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) to communicate with tools. It's designed to solve the problem of tool discovery and interaction in a standardized way.
MCP supports networked environments using HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing an AI agent to interact with tools hosted on remote servers across the internet.

For developers building AI applications, MCP offers practical advantages:

- **Standardized Interfaces:** MCP provides common patterns for tool definitions. This reduces the need for custom integration code for each LLM provider, allowing you to swap backends to optimize for cost or performance with less refactoring.
- **LLM-Optimized Tool Definitions:** The protocol acknowledges that APIs for LLMs differ from traditional developer APIs. LLM-facing tools require richer descriptive context and metadata for the model to use them effectively, a distinction MCP incorporates into its design.
- **Reusable Components:** Growing adoption means access to a larger ecosystem of MCP-compliant tools and resources. This allows developers to leverage existing, tested components rather than building everything from scratch.

## Authentication and Authorization for MCP Servers

When an MCP server is exposed to the internet, it must be secured. The MCP specification recommends using [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/) to secure these interactions. This allows an MCP server to delegate authentication to a dedicated authorization server and manage access control for different clients, users, and actions using scopes.

### Mandatory Server Configuration

For a client to interact with your server, the MCP specification requires you to announce your authorization configuration and use standard HTTP responses.

1. Announce Your Auth Server with Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))

Your MCP server must tell clients where to get authorized. To do this, you must expose a metadata endpoint. Create a `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` endpoint on your server that returns a JSON object pointing to your Auth0 tenant. This allows MCP clients to automatically discover your authorization endpoints without manual configuration.

2. Use the `WWW-Authenticate` Header for 401 Errors

When a client makes a request without a valid token, your server must return a `401 Unauthorized` status. Crucially, this response must include the `WWW-Authenticate` header, pointing to the metadata URL you configured above. This signals to the client that authentication is required and tells it exactly where to start the process.

## Implementing MCP Security with Auth0

By using Auth0 as your authorization server, you can secure your MCP server without building and maintaining a complex identity system yourself. The MCP specification highlights several key OAuth 2.1 features that Auth0 provides:

- **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE):** [PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) mandatory security feature that mitigates authorization code interception and is handled automatically in Auth0's SDKs.
- **Metadata Discovery:** Is mandatory per the MCP spec. Servers must advertise their OAuth endpoints. An Auth0 tenant provides [an authorization server discovery document](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/configure-applications-with-oidc-discovery#configure-applications-with-oauth-2-0-authorization-server-metadata) (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) so MCP clients can dynamically find the required endpoints for authorization, token exchange, etc., reducing manual client-side configuration.
- **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR):** DCR is crucial for scalability. It allows MCP clients (like a generic AI workbench) to programmatically register with your Auth0-secured MCP server via an API call. This avoids forcing users to manually create a client application in the Auth0 Dashboard for every new tool they want to connect.
- **Delegating Authentication to a Third-Party Identity Provider(IdP):** The specification supports delegating the user login process. You can configure your MCP server to use Auth0 as the trusted identity provider, centralizing user management and sign-on logic.

## MCP Authorization Flow with Auth0

Here is the standard OAuth authorization code flow when an MCP server uses Auth0 as its authorization server:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    The MCP client sends a request to the protected MCP server and receives HTTP `401 Unauthorized` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header that indicates the protected resource metadata URL.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The MCP client requests the [resource metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728/) from the MCP server at the `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The MCP client parses the metadata, selects an authorization server (Auth0) from the list, and then fetches its OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata from the `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` endpoint. [Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/dynamic-client-registration#enable-dynamic-client-registration) can happen after receiving the metadata response.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The client generates [PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) parameters and builds the authorization request, then opens the browser to the authorization endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The user then authenticates with Auth0 (using username/password, social login, or MFA). Auth0 redirects the browser to the MCP clientâ€™s registered redirect URI with an authorization code.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The MCP client exchanges the code at the token endpoint and Auth0 returns the access token completing the original OAuth flow.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After receiving an access token (and refresh token), the MCP client will use the access token to make authenticated calls to the MCP server's tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Access Token Validation

Receiving a token is not enough. Your MCP server must validate every token to ensure it is authentic and intended for your server. This involves several checks:

- **Verify the Token Signature:** Check that the token was signed by Auth0.
- **Check the Expiration Time (`exp` claim):** Ensure the token has not expired.
- **Validate the Audience (`aud` claim):** This is the most important check. Verify that the aud claim exactly matches your server's unique identifier.
- **Verify the Issuer (`iss` claim):** Check that the token was issued by your Auth0 tenant.

Auth0's SDKs can perform these checks automatically. You apply this validation as a middleware to your protected routes.

## Security Best Practices: Sessions and Requests

**1. Do Not Use Sessions for Authentication**
The MCP specification **prohibits** using sessions for authentication. The bearer access token is the only valid credential. You must verify the access token on **every single inbound request** to a protected endpoint. This stateless authentication model is more secure and prevents session hijacking attacks.

**2. Verify All Inbound Requests**
Security is a continuous process. Explicitly state in your documentation that **all** inbound requests to tool endpoints must be verified to contain a valid, validated access token. Use middleware (like the one that performs the token validation) to protect every relevant route.
