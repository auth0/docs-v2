sidebarTitle: Metadata Discovery and Client Registration
---

After receiving the metadata from the MCP server and the authorization server, the MCP client can be registered through either exchanging the client credentials or by performing Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

<Warning>Auth0 supports [Open Dynamic Registration](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/dynamic-client-registration#enable-dynamic-client-registration), which means that if you enable this feature, anyone will be able to create applications in your tenant without a token. Read [Securing Open DCR Endpoints](/mcp/intro/metadata-discovery-and-client-registration#securing-open-dcr-endpoints) to learn strategies to mitigate risks with Open DCR.</Warning>

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an MCP server that can:

* Let users sign up and log in using a username and password or a Google account.  
* Authenticate and authorize users using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.  
* Let users use specific tools based on their roles.  
* Allow your client to automatically register an application

## Pre-requisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or log in to your Auth0 Account">
      To continue with this quickstart, you need to have an [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable your Tenant to use the Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile">
      To use the `resource` parameter in your access tokens, you need to enable the compatibility profile

      1. Navigate to Settings and click on the **Advanced** tab  
      2. Scroll down to the Settings section, find and enable **Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile**.
      <Frame>
        <img
          className="hidden dark:block"
          src="/img/mcp/enable_resource_param_compatibility_dark.png"
          alt="Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile enabled"
        />
        <img
          className="block dark:hidden"
          src="/img/mcp/enable_resource_param_compatibility_light.png"
          alt="Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile enabled"
        />
      </Frame>
      Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile is available under the Early Access program. Go to the [Early Access section](/mcp/intro/overview#early-access) to learn how to gain access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Auth0 CLI ">
      This guide uses [Auth0 CLI](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/) to configure an Auth0 tenant for secure MCP tool access.
      1. Follow the [Auth0 CLI installation instructions](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/).  
      2. Log in to your account with the Auth0 CLI:
        ```shell wrap lines
        auth0 login --scopes "read:client_grants,create:client_grants,delete:client_grants,read:clients,create:clients,update:clients,read:resource_servers,create:resource_servers,update:resource_servers,read:roles,create:roles,update:roles,update:tenant_settings,read:connections,update:connections"
        ```

        Confirm you are in the correct tenant by double-checking on the terminal the tenant domain, or run the command below:

        ```shell
        auth0 tenants list
        ```

        If more than one tenant is configured, the default tenant will be indicated by an arrow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improve user consent experience">
    Enable the [user-friendly descriptions for scopes](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications/user-consent-and-third-party-applications#scope-descriptions) on the consent screen:

    ```shell wrap lines
    auth0 tenant-settings update set flags.use_scope_descriptions_for_consent
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enable Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)

Set the tenant-level flag required for Dynamic Client Registration (DCR):

```shell wrap lines
auth0 tenant-settings update set flags.enable_dynamic_client_registration
```

Enabling `enable_dynamic_client_registration` allows MCP tools to register themselves as applications automatically through Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

<Warning>Auth0 supports Open Dynamic Registration, which means that if you enable this feature, anyone will be able to create applications in your tenant without a token. Read [Securing Open DCR Endpoints](/mcp/intro/metadata-discovery-and-client-registration#securing-open-dcr-endpoints) to learn strategies to mitigate risks with Open DCR.</Warning>


## Configure Tenant Settings

To allow third-party clients like [MCP inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) to use a connection like username-and-password or a social connection, you need to promote the connection to a domain level. [Learn more about enabling third-party applications](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications/enable-third-party-applications).

<Steps>
  <Step title="List your connection">
    List your connections to get their IDs
    ```shell
    auth0 api get connections
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your connections">
    From the list, identify which connections you want to use for the MCP server and copy the ID.  
      * For the username and password database, look for the connection with the strategy `auth0`.  
      * For Google social connection, look for the connection with the strategy `google-oauth2`.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upgrade the connection to domain-level">
    For each of those specific connection IDs, run the following command to mark it as a domain-level connection. Replace `YOUR_CONNECTION_ID` with the actual ID (e.g., `con_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

    ```shell wrap lines
    auth0 api patch connections/YOUR_CONNECTION_ID --data '{"is_domain_connection": true}'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Create an API to Represent Your MCP Server

The API (also known as a Resource Server) represents your protected MCP Server and sets it as the default for your tenant.


```shell wrap lines

auth0 api post resource-servers --data '{
  "identifier": "http://localhost:3001/",
  "name": "MCP Tools API",
  "signing_alg": "RS256",
  "token_dialect": "rfc9068_profile_authz",
  "enforce_policies": true,
  "scopes": [
    {"value": "tool:whoami", "description": "Access the WhoAmI tool"},
    {"value": "tool:greet", "description": "Access the Greeting tool"}
  ]
}'
```

Note that `rfc9068_profile_authz` is used instead of ` rfc9068_profile` as the [token dialect](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/enable-role-based-access-control-for-apis#token-dialect-options) to enable RBAC.

## Configure Roles and Permissions

The sample application in this quickstart is prepared to show different tools depending on the role of a given user. For example an Tool Administrator will have access to different tools from an Tool User.

If your application doesn’t require that level of access, i.e. all users have access to available tools, this step is not required for your use case.

Let’s create roles that allow you to control which users can access which tools.

### Create roles

For each role you need (e.g., "Tool Administrator", "Tool User"), run the create command as below.

```shell wrap lines
# Example for an admin role
auth0 roles create --name "Tool Administrator" --description "Grants access to all MCP tools"

# Example for a basic user role
auth0 roles create --name "Tool User" --description "Grants access to basic MCP tools"
```

Save the ID from the output (they start with `rol_`) as you’ll need them for the next step.

### Assign permissions to roles

After creating roles, assign the API permissions to it:

```shell wrap lines
# Example for admin role (all scopes)
auth0 roles permissions add YOUR_ADMIN_ROLE_ID --api-id "http://localhost:3001/" --permissions "tool:whoami,tool:greet"

# Example for user role (one scope)
auth0 roles permissions add YOUR_USER_ROLE_ID --api-id "http://localhost:3001/" --permissions "tool:whoami"
```

### Assign Roles to Users

Find users and assign them to the roles. You can search by their email address:

```shell wrap lines
auth0 users search --query "email:\"example@google.com\""
```

Copy the user ID (`USERID`) from last command’s output then assign the role to the user:

```shell wrap lines
auth0 users roles assign "USER_ID_HERE" --roles "YOUR_ROLE_ID_HERE"
```

## Clone the sample app

Clone the repository and navigate to the correct folder:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples.git
cd auth0-ai-samples/auth-for-mcp/fastmcp-mcp-js
```

This repository contains the code for various MCP servers examples, for this quickstart you are going to use the FastMCP MCP Server with Auth0 Integration in JavaScript.

## Create your environment file

In the `fastmcp-mcp-js` directory, create a new `.env` file and add the following content:

```shell
AUTH0_DOMAIN=<your-auth0-domain>
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=http://localhost:3001
PORT=3001
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

To get your Auth0 application’s `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, run the following command:

```shell
auth0 tenants list
```

Copy the domain under `TENANT` from the output and update the corresponding variable on the `.env`.

## Run your application and login

Run this command to start your server:

```shell
npm run start
```

Now in a separate terminal window, on the `fastmcp-mcp-js` folder run the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector):

```shell
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```

This will open the MCP Inspector interface on your default browser. 

<Warning>
Because of DCR MCP Inspector will create one application in your tenant every time you run it because it doesn’t cache the application information to re-use it. Read [Securing Open DCR Endpoints](/mcp/intro/metadata-discovery-and-client-registration#securing-open-dcr-endpoints) to learn strategies to mitigate risks with Open DCR.
</Warning>

</Frame>

Click on the **Open Auth Settings** button then in **Quick OAuth Flow.**

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/img/mcp/authentication_settings_page_in_mcp_inspector.png"
    alt="Authentication settings page in MCP Inspector"
  />
</Frame>

This will open a tab with the Auth0 Universal Login page for you to login.

  <img
    class="img-sizing"
    src="/img/mcp/consent_screen_while_logging_in.png"
    alt="Consent modal while authenticating"
  />
</Frame>

Use the same user you gave access to the tools in the previous step. You can sign in with that account on future visits.

When you perform the Quick OAuth Flow button, MCP Inspector performs all the steps in the OAuth Flow Progress section as outlined in the [MCP authorization flow with Auth0](/mcp/core-concepts/core-concepts#mcp-authorization-flow-with-auth0). 

## Run your tools

In the MCP Inspector, select `Streamable HTTP` as the **Transport Type** and enter `http://localhost:3001/mcp` as the URL then click **Connect**. Since you already logged in the previous step, you should see the Tools tab.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/img/mcp/mcp_inspector_after_login.png"
    alt="MCP Inspector page after running it"
  />
</Frame>

Now you can **List Tools** to see what tools are available for your user. Users with the **Tool User** role will only see the `whoami` tool:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/img/mcp/tools_list_tool_user_role.png"
    alt="List of tools for an user with the Tool User role"
  />
</Frame>

Whereas users with the **Tool Administrator** role will see both the `greet` and the `whoami` tools:  

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/img/mcp/tools_list_tool_administrator_role.png"
    alt="List of tools for an user with the Tool Administrator role"
  />
</Frame>

Now, click on the tool you want to use and **Run Tool**.

  <img
    src="/img/mcp/whoami_tool_call_through_mcp_inspector.png"
    alt="WhoAmI tool call response in MCP Inspector"
  />
</Frame>

<Warning>Auth0 supports Open Dynamic Registration, which means that if you enable this feature, anyone will be able to create applications in your tenant without a token.
