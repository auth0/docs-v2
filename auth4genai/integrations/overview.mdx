An Integration in Auth0 is a relationship between Auth0 and a source of users, such as third-party applications (like Slack or Salesforce) or external Identity Providers (like Google or Microsoft). These Integrations allow users to log in to your application using those identities and share their data from that application to your AI agents.

## Why Use Integrations?

Integrations enable your GenAI applications to access rich, real-time data from the platforms your users already use. This allows you to:

- **Personalize AI responses** with user-specific data from their connected accounts
- **Automate workflows** by performing actions on behalf of users across platforms
- **Reduce friction** by eliminating the need for users to manually provide data
- **Enhance context** by pulling relevant information from multiple sources
