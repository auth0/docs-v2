The Microsoft Entra integration allows users to authenticate with your AI agents using their Microsoft Entra identity. This integration provides access to Microsoft's ecosystem of applications and services and is essential for B2B scenarios where users need to access their work data and collaborate through Microsoft services.

## Connect Microsoft Entra with Auth0

To set up a Microsoft Entra connection with Auth0, follow the [Connect Your App to Microsoft Entra](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/azure-active-directory/v2) detailed guide.

<IntegrationInfoBlock providerName="Microsoft Entra" />

## Token Vault configuration example

To configure the Token Vault for your Microsoft Entra connection, you can use the following code snippet in your application:

<TokenVaultConfigBlock
  providerName="Microsoft Entra"
  connectionName="microsoft-azure-connection-name"
  scopes={["https://graph.microsoft.com/Files.Read", "https://graph.microsoft.com/Directory.Read.All"]}
 />
