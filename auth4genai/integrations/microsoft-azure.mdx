The Microsoft Azure integration allows users to authenticate with your AI agents using their Microsoft Azure AD identity. This integration provides access to Microsoft's ecosystem of applications and services and is essential for B2B scenarios where users need to access their work data and collaborate through Microsoft services.

## Connect Microsoft Azure with Auth0

To set up a Microsoft Azure connection with Auth0, follow the [Connect Your App to Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/azure-active-directory/v2) detailed guide.

<IntegrationInfoBlock providerName="Microsoft Azure" />

## Token Vault configuration example

To configure the Token Vault for your Microsoft Azure connection, you can use the following code snippet in your application:

<TokenVaultConfigBlock
  providerName="Microsoft Azure"
  connectionName="microsoft-azure-connection-name"
  scopes={["https://graph.microsoft.com/Files.Read", "https://graph.microsoft.com/Directory.Read.All"]}
 />
