The Figma integration allows your AI Agents to authenticate users with their Figma accounts and access Figma files, projects, and design assets on their behalf.

## Overview

The Figma integration is perfect for design-focused AI applications that need to interact with design files, manage projects, collaborate on designs, or automate design workflows. This integration provides access to Figma's comprehensive API for design and collaboration features.
