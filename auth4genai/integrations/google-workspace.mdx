The Google Workspace integration allows users to authenticate with your AI agents using their Google Workspace identity. This integration provides access to Google's ecosystem of applications and services and is essential for B2B scenarios where users need to access their work data and collaborate through Google services.

## Connect Google Workspace with Auth0

To set up a Google Workspace connection with Auth0, follow the [Connect Your App to Google Workspace](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/google-apps) detailed guide.

<IntegrationInfoBlock providerName="Google Workspace" />

## Token Vault configuration example

To configure the Token Vault for your Google Workspace connection, you can use the following code snippet in your application:

<TokenVaultConfigBlock
  providerName="Google Workspace"
  connectionName="google-workspace-connection-name"
  scopes={["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly"]}
 />
