The custom OAuth2 connection allows you to create integrations with any OAuth2 compliant service that isn't available as a built-in integration type.

## Overview

If a specific identity provider or service isn't available out of the box, Auth0 allows you to create custom social connections. This is particularly useful for integrating with proprietary systems, regional services, or specialized OAuth2 providers.

To learn more and configure a custom OAuth2 connection with Auth0, see our [Connect Apps to Generic OAuth2 Authorization Servers documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/oauth2).

## Configure Connected Accounts

After creating the connection, in the **Purpose** section, toggle on **Use for Connected Accounts**. This allows your connection to retrieve and securely store access tokens for external APIs. To learn more, read [Connected Accounts for Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault/connected-accounts-for-token-vault).
