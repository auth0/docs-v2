The GitHub integration allows your AI Agents to authenticate users with their GitHub accounts and access GitHub repositories and manage issues their behalf.

## Overview

The GitHub integration is perfect for developer focused AI applications that need to interact with code repositories, manage issues, or automate development workflows. This integration provides access to both public and private repositories based on user permissions.

## Configuration

<Warning>
<strong>GitHub app permissions</strong>

GitHub apps [use fine grained permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.17/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps#requesting-permission-levels-for-resources) and hence requesting permissions when configuring Token Vault is not supported. Instead, you should set the required permissions when creating the GitHub app in the GitHub developer settings.

</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up app in Github">
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sign up for a [GitHub Developer account](https://github.com/signup)
      </li>
      <li>
        Set up a new GitHub app via [GitHub Developer Settings > GitHub
        Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the following settings when configuring your GitHub app:
        <ul>
          <li>Homepage URL: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN`</li>
          <li>Callback URL: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/login/callback`</li>
          <li>Webhook Active: Disabled</li>
          <li>Permissions: Select the appropriate permissions for your app</li>
        </ul>
        <FindDomainInfoBlock />
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the app and generate a new client secret in the app settings page
        that appears.
      </li>
      <li>Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**</li>
    </ol>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the GitHub Social Connection in Auth0">
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/), navigate to
        **Authentication > Social**. Select **Create Connection** and then
        **GitHub**. Click **Continue**.
      </li>
      <li>
        In **General**, enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the
        GitHub OAuth app you created.
      </li>
      <li>
        In **Advanced**, toggle **Enable Token Vault**. This allows the
        connection to retrieve and store access tokens for third-party APIs
        securely. To learn more, read [Configure Token
        Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault/configure-token-vault).
      </li>
      <li>Click **Create**.</li>
      <li>
        After saving, go the **Applications** tab and select the applications
        that should use this connection.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token Vault configuration Example

To configure the Token Vault for your GitHub connection, you can use the following code snippet in your application:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript" icon="js">
    ```tsx wrap lines
    const auth0AI = new Auth0AI();

    export const withGitHubConnection = auth0AI.withTokenForConnection({
      connection: "github",
      // scopes are not supported for GitHub yet. Set required scopes when creating the accompanying GitHub app
      scopes: [],
      refreshToken: getAuth0RefreshToken(),
    });
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python" icon="python">
    ```python wrap lines
    auth0_ai = Auth0AI()

    with_github_connection = auth0_ai.with_token_vault(
        connection="github",
        # scopes are not supported for GitHub yet. Set required scopes when creating the accompanying GitHub app
        scopes=[],
        refresh_token=get_auth0_refresh_token,
    )
    ```

  </Tab>
