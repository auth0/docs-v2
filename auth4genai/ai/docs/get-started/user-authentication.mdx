Authentication is the process of proving a user's identity before granting them access to a resource. In this quickstart, you'll learn how to bring [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) to your GenAI application and leverage OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to securely authenticate users.

When a user authenticates with an identity provider through Auth0, Auth0 can pass user information in an ID token to an application or AI agent to deliver a personalized experience. For example, a chatbot can greet a user with their name and display relevant information based on the user's profile.

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an application that can:

- Sign up and log in using a username and password or a Google account.
- Authenticate and authorize users using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have completed the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Auth0 Account and a Dev Tenant">
  To continue with this quickstart, you need an [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup?onboard_app=genai&ocid=7014z000001NyoxAAC-aPA4z0000008OZeGAM) and a Developer Tenant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Auth0 Application">
    [Create and configure an Auth0 Application](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) with the following properties:
    - Type: `Regular Web`
    - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
