Authentication is the process of proving a user's identity before granting them access to a resource. In this quickstart, you'll learn how to bring [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) to your AI agent and leverage OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to securely authenticate users.

When a user authenticates with an identity provider through Auth0, Auth0 can pass user information in an ID token to an application or AI agent to deliver a personalized experience. For example, a chatbot can greet a user with their name and display relevant information based on the user's profile.

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an application that can:

- Sign up and log in using a username and password or a Google account.
- Authenticate and authorize users using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
