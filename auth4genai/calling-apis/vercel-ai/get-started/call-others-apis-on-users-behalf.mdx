Use Auth0 SDKs to fetch access tokens for social and enterprise identity providers from Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault). Using these access tokens, AI agents integrated with the application can call third-party APIs to perform tasks on the user's behalf.

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an AI application integrated with Auth0 that can:

1. Retrieve access tokens for a Google social connection.
2. Integrate with an AI agent to call Google APIs.
