import CloudflareCallYourApi from "/snippets/get-started/cloudflare-agents-js/call-your-api.mdx";

Let your AI agent call your APIs on behalf of the authenticated user using access tokens securely issued by Auth0. Your API can be any [API that you have configured in Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis).

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an AI application integrated with Auth0 that can:

- Get an Auth0 access token.
- Use the Auth0 access token to make a tool call to your API endpoint, in this case, Auth0's `/userinfo` endpoint.
- Return the data to the user via an AI agent.
