### User authentication

Securely authenticate users in your AI agents using Auth0's [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) with support for social, enterprise, and custom identity providers. This allows you to leverage robust standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to secure both interactive and headless AI agents. [Learn More](./user-authentication).

### Call your APIs on a user's behalf

Enable AI agents to securely call your application's own APIs (first-party APIs) on behalf of a user using OAuth 2.0. This pattern ensures that the user's context is maintained, preventing agents from having broad, unrestricted access to all user data. [Learn More](./call-your-apis-on-users-behalf).

### Call other's APIs on a user's behalf using Token Vault

Securely connect AI agents to external tools and services like Google, Slack, or GitHub. Our Token Vault feature manages the complexities of obtaining, storing, and refreshing API tokens, allowing your agents to interact with third-party APIs without handling sensitive credentials or API keys directly. [Learn More](./token-vault).

### Asynchronous authorization

Implement "human-in-the-loop" workflows for actions that are long-running or require user consent. Using standards like [CIBA (Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow), agents can request approval for sensitive operations via push notifications, SMS, or email, even when the user is not actively using the application. [Learn More](./asynchronous-authorization).

### Authorization for RAG

Enforce fine-grained, document-level access control within your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization). This ensures that when a Large Language Model (LLM) generates a response, it only uses data that the current user is authorized to see, preventing [sensitive data leakage](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm022025-sensitive-information-disclosure/) and ensuring compliance. [Learn More](./authorization-for-rag).
