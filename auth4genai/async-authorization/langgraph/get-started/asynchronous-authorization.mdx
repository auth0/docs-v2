Auth for GenAI enables AI agents to asynchronously authorize users using the [Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow (CIBA)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow). AI agents can work in the background, only notifying the user when needed for critical actions.

When you add secure [human-in-the-loop approvals](https://sdk.vercel.ai/cookbook/next/human-in-the-loop) to your AI agent workflows, you can use Auth0 to request the user's permission to complete an authorization request. The AI agent can render [rich authorization data](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow/user-authorization-with-ciba) in the consent prompt so the user knows exactly what they're authorizing.

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an AI agent integrated with the [Auth0 AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-ai-js) that can request to buy products from an online shop on the user's behalf.
