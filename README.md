# Auth0 Documentation: docs-v2

The home of https://auth0.com/docs and https://auth0.com/ai/docs.

This repo contains the content, configuration, and styling for much of Auth0's documentation. It's a [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) monorepo with the following structure:

* The `main` directory contains the main product documentation site at https://auth0.com/docs.

* The `auth4genai` directory contains the Auth0 for AI Agents docs site at https://auth0.com/ai/docs.

* The `ui` directory contains a shared React component library for both docs sites. (See [the Docs UI library README](./ui/README.md) for more information.)

To contribute to the docs, please coordinate with the Auth0 Product Docs and/or Product Management team, then read our [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
