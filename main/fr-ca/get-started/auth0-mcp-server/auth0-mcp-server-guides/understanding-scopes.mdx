For security purposes, the Auth0 Model Context Protocol server grants no scopes by default and required scopes must be requested during initialization. After your server is initialized, you can manually set scopes using a glob pattern, an example of which is below:

```javascript lines
# Select all read scopes
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --scopes 'read:*'

# Select multiple scope patterns (comma-separated)
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --scopes 'read:*,create:clients,update:actions'
```

Depending on the type of management operation or tool you wish to use, you may need to request additional scopes to successfully execute the MCP operation on your client. Below are the available scopes.
