Auth0 Multiple <Tooltip href="/docs/fr-ca/glossary?term=custom-domain" tip="Domaine personnalisé

This simplifies identity management while providing a seamless, branded experience for your users.

### Single brand, multiple top-level domains (TLDs)

Some businesses, like airlines, require different top-level domain names (for example: `.com`, `.co.uk`, `.com.au`) even with a single user base. This is often driven by jurisdictional regulations or customer preferences. With MCD, you can easily create this setup in Auth0, running a single tenant with a unified user store while offering multiple top-level domains. For example, your primary website might be `exampleco.com`, but you can also operate `exampleco.co.uk` and `exampleco.com.au`.

### Multiple brands, single user base

It is common for businesses to own several brands, each with its own domain, but benefit from a single user store and other unified features of a single Auth0 tenant. In retail, for instance, a company might manage distinct brands offering upscale home furniture (`brand1-home-furniture.com`) and office furniture (`brand2-office-furniture.com`). MCD allows these brands to maintain separate domain names while sharing a centralized user store and Auth0 setup.

### White-labeled B2B SaaS

Many SaaS providers offer their services in a white-labeled model. Imagine job-saas.com, a platform for managing job applications. Client companies can host `job-saas.com` services under a subdomain of their own and customize its look and feel, such as `jobs.client-a.com` and `jobs.client-b.com`. With MCD, `job-saas.com` can maintain its entire Auth0 configuration in a single tenant, yet offer different organizations and custom domains directly to its customers.
