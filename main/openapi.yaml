      summary: Deploy an action
      description: |
        Deploy an action. Deploying an action will create a new immutable version of the action. If the action is currently bound to a trigger, then the system will begin executing the newly deployed version of the action immediately. Otherwise, the action will only be executed as a part of a flow once it is bound to that flow.

        Notes:
        - We recommend leaving the `client_secret` parameter unspecified to allow the generation of a safe secret.
        - The <code>client_authentication_methods</code> and <code>token_endpoint_auth_method</code> properties are mutually exclusive. Use
        <code>client_authentication_methods</code> to configure the client with Private Key JWT authentication method. Otherwise, use <code>token_endpoint_auth_method</code>
        to configure the client with client secret (basic or post) or with no authentication method (none).
        - When using <code>client_authentication_methods</code> to configure the client with Private Key JWT authentication method, specify fully defined credentials.
        These credentials will be automatically enabled for Private Key JWT authentication on the client.
        - To configure <code>client_authentication_methods</code>, the <code>create:client_credentials</code> scope is required.
        - To configure <code>client_authentication_methods</code>, the property <code>jwt_configuration.alg</code> must be set to RS256.

      summary: Create a client credential
      description: |
        Create a client credential associated to your application. Credentials can be used to configure Private Key JWT and mTLS authentication methods, as well as for JWT-secured Authorization requests.

        <h5>Public Key</h5>Public Key credentials can be used to set up Private Key JWT client authentication and JWT-secured Authorization requests.

        Sample: <pre><code>{
          "credential_type": "public_key",
          "name": "string",
          "pem": "string",
          "alg": "RS256",
          "parse_expiry_from_cert": false,
          "expires_at": "2022-12-31T23:59:59Z"
        }</code></pre>
        <h5>Certificate (CA-signed & self-signed)</h5>Certificate credentials can be used to set up mTLS client authentication. CA-signed certificates can be configured either with a signed certificate or with just the certificate Subject DN.

        CA-signed Certificate Sample (pem): <pre><code>{
          "credential_type": "x509_cert",
          "name": "string",
          "pem": "string"
        }</code></pre>CA-signed Certificate Sample (subject_dn): <pre><code>{
          "credential_type": "cert_subject_dn",
          "name": "string",
          "subject_dn": "string"
        }</code></pre>Self-signed Certificate Sample: <pre><code>{
          "credential_type": "cert_subject_dn",
          "name": "string",
          "pem": "string"
        }</code></pre>

        The credential will be created but not yet enabled for use until you set the corresponding properties in the client:
        <ul>
          <li>To enable the credential for Private Key JWT or mTLS authentication methods, set the <code>client_authentication_methods</code> property on the client. For more information, read <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/configure-private-key-jwt">Configure Private Key JWT Authentication</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/configure-mtls">Configure mTLS Authentication</a></li>
          <li>To enable the credential for JWT-secured Authorization requests, set the <code>signed_request_object</code>property on the client. For more information, read <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/configure-jar">Configure JWT-secured Authorization Requests (JAR)</a></li>

        Notes:
        - The `client_secret` and `signing_key` attributes can only be updated with the `update:client_keys` scope.
        - The <code>client_authentication_methods</code> and <code>token_endpoint_auth_method</code> properties are mutually exclusive. Use
        <code>client_authentication_methods</code> to configure the client with Private Key JWT authentication method. Otherwise, use <code>token_endpoint_auth_method</code>
        to configure the client with client secret (basic or post) or with no authentication method (none).
        - When using <code>client_authentication_methods</code> to configure the client with Private Key JWT authentication method, only specify the credential IDs
        that were generated when creating the credentials on the client.
        - To configure <code>client_authentication_methods</code>, the <code>update:client_credentials</code> scope is required.
        - To configure <code>client_authentication_methods</code>, the property <code>jwt_configuration.alg</code> must be set to RS256.

      description: |
        Retrieves detailed list of all <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers">connections</a> that match the specified strategy. If no strategy is provided, all connections within your tenant are retrieved. This action can accept a list of fields to include or exclude from the resulting list of connections.

        This endpoint supports two types of pagination:
        <ul>
        <li>Offset pagination</li>
        <li>Checkpoint pagination</li>
        </ul>

        Checkpoint pagination must be used if you need to retrieve more than 1000 connections.

        <h2>Checkpoint Pagination</h2>

        To search by checkpoint, use the following parameters:
        <ul>
        <li><code>from</code>: Optional id from which to start selection.</li>
        <li><code>take</code>: The total amount of entries to retrieve when using the from parameter. Defaults to 50.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Note</b>: The first time you call this endpoint using checkpoint pagination, omit the <code>from</code> parameter. If there are more results, a <code>next</code> value is included in the response. You can use this for subsequent API calls. When <code>next</code> is no longer included in the response, no pages are remaining.

        Optional attributes that can be updated:

        - custom_client_ip_header
        - tls_policy


        TLS Policies:

        - recommended - for modern usage this includes TLS 1.2 only
        - compatible - compatible with older browsers this policy includes TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2


        Some considerations:

        - The TLS ciphers and protocols available in each TLS policy follow industry recommendations, and may be updated occasionally.
        - Do not use the <code>compatible</code> TLS policy unless you have clients that require TLS 1.0.

        Update a custom domain.

        These are the attributes that can be updated:

        - custom_client_ip_header
        - tls_policy

        <h5>Updating CUSTOM_CLIENT_IP_HEADER for a custom domain</h5>To update the <code>custom_client_ip_header</code> for a domain, the body to
        send should be:
        <pre><code>{ "custom_client_ip_header": "cf-connecting-ip" }</code></pre>

        <h5>Updating TLS_POLICY for a custom domain</h5>To update the <code>tls_policy</code> for a domain, the body to send should be:
        <pre><code>{ "tls_policy": "recommended" }</code></pre>


        TLS Policies:

        - recommended - for modern usage this includes TLS 1.2 only


        Some considerations:

        - The TLS ciphers and protocols available in each TLS policy follow industry recommendations, and may be updated occasionally.
        - The <code>compatible</code> TLS policy is no longer supported.

        Run the verification process on a custom domain.

        Note: Check the <code>status</code> field to see its verification status. Once verification is complete, it may take up to 10 minutes before the custom domain can start accepting requests.

        For <code>self_managed_certs</code>, when the custom domain is verified for the first time, the response will also include the <code>cname_api_key</code> which you will need to configure your proxy. This key must be kept secret, and is used to validate the proxy requests.

      description: |
        Update an <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/email/providers">email provider</a>. The <code>credentials</code> object
        requires different properties depending on the email provider (which is specified using the <code>name</code> property):
        <ul>
          <li><code>mandrill</code> requires <code>api_key</code></li>
          <li><code>sendgrid</code> requires <code>api_key</code></li>
          <li>
            <code>sparkpost</code> requires <code>api_key</code>. Optionally, set <code>region</code> to <code>eu</code> to use
            the SparkPost service hosted in Western Europe; set to <code>null</code> to use the SparkPost service hosted in
            North America. <code>eu</code> or <code>null</code> are the only valid values for <code>region</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>mailgun</code> requires <code>api_key</code> and <code>domain</code>. Optionally, set <code>region</code> to
            <code>eu</code> to use the Mailgun service hosted in Europe; set to <code>null</code> otherwise. <code>eu</code> or
            <code>null</code> are the only valid values for <code>region</code>.
          </li>
          <li><code>ses</code> requires <code>accessKeyId</code>, <code>secretAccessKey</code>, and <code>region</code></li>
          <li>
            <code>smtp</code> requires <code>smtp_host</code>, <code>smtp_port</code>, <code>smtp_user</code>, and
            <code>smtp_pass</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Depending on the type of provider it is possible to specify <code>settings</code> object with different configuration
        options, which will be used when sending an email:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>smtp</code> provider, <code>settings</code> may contain <code>headers</code> object.
            <ul>

      summary: Configure email provider
      description: |
        Create an <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/email/providers">email provider</a>. The <code>credentials</code> object
        requires different properties depending on the email provider (which is specified using the <code>name</code> property):
        <ul>
          <li><code>mandrill</code> requires <code>api_key</code></li>
          <li><code>sendgrid</code> requires <code>api_key</code></li>
          <li>
            <code>sparkpost</code> requires <code>api_key</code>. Optionally, set <code>region</code> to <code>eu</code> to use
            the SparkPost service hosted in Western Europe; set to <code>null</code> to use the SparkPost service hosted in
            North America. <code>eu</code> or <code>null</code> are the only valid values for <code>region</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>mailgun</code> requires <code>api_key</code> and <code>domain</code>. Optionally, set <code>region</code> to
            <code>eu</code> to use the Mailgun service hosted in Europe; set to <code>null</code> otherwise. <code>eu</code> or
            <code>null</code> are the only valid values for <code>region</code>.
          </li>
          <li><code>ses</code> requires <code>accessKeyId</code>, <code>secretAccessKey</code>, and <code>region</code></li>
          <li>
            <code>smtp</code> requires <code>smtp_host</code>, <code>smtp_port</code>, <code>smtp_user</code>, and
            <code>smtp_pass</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Depending on the type of provider it is possible to specify <code>settings</code> object with different configuration
        options, which will be used when sending an email:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>smtp</code> provider, <code>settings</code> may contain <code>headers</code> object.
            <ul>
              <li>
                When using AWS SES SMTP host, you may provide a name of configuration set in
                <code>X-SES-Configuration-Set</code> header. Value must be a string.
              </li>
              <li>
                When using Sparkpost host, you may provide value for
                <code>X-MSYS_API</code> header. Value must be an object.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            for <code>ses</code> provider, <code>settings</code> may contain <code>message</code> object, where you can provide
            a name of configuration set in <code>configuration_set_name</code> property. Value must be a string.
          </li>
        </ul>

      summary: Search log events
      description: |
        Retrieve log entries that match the specified search criteria (or all log entries if no criteria specified).

        Set custom search criteria using the <code>q</code> parameter, or search from a specific log ID (<i>"search from checkpoint"</i>).

        For more information on all possible event types, their respective acronyms, and descriptions, see <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/logs/log-event-type-codes">Log Event Type Codes</a>.

        <h5>To set custom search criteria, use the following parameters:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><b>q:</b> Search Criteria using <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/logs/log-search-query-syntax">Query String Syntax</a></li>
            <li><b>page:</b> Page index of the results to return. First page is 0.</li>
            <li><b>per_page:</b> Number of results per page.</li>
            <li><b>sort:</b> Field to use for sorting appended with `:1` for ascending and `:-1` for descending. e.g. `date:-1`</li>
            <li><b>fields:</b> Comma-separated list of fields to include or exclude (depending on include_fields) from the result, empty to retrieve all fields.</li>
            <li><b>include_fields:</b> Whether specified fields are to be included (true) or excluded (false).</li>
            <li><b>include_totals:</b> Return results inside an object that contains the total result count (true) or as a direct array of results (false, default). <b>Deprecated:</b> this field is deprecated and should be removed from use. See <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations/migrate-to-tenant-log-search-v3#pagination">Search Engine V3 Breaking Changes</a></li>
        </ul>

        For more information on the list of fields that can be used in <code>fields</code> and <code>sort</code>, see <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/logs/log-search-query-syntax#searchable-fields">Searchable Fields</a>.

        Auth0 <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/logs/retrieve-log-events-using-mgmt-api#limitations">limits the number of logs</a> you can return by search criteria to 100 logs per request. Furthermore, you may paginate only through 1,000 search results. If you exceed this threshold, please redefine your search or use the <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/logs/retrieve-log-events-using-mgmt-api#retrieve-logs-by-checkpoint">get logs by checkpoint method</a>.

        <h5>To search from a checkpoint log ID, use the following parameters:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>from:</b> Log Event ID from which to start retrieving logs. You can limit the number of logs returned using the <code>take</code> parameter. If you use <code>from</code> at the same time as <code>q</code>, <code>from</code> takes precedence and <code>q</code> is ignored.</li>

        This endpoint supports two types of pagination:
        <ul>
        <li>Offset pagination</li>
        <li>Checkpoint pagination</li>
        </ul>

        Checkpoint pagination must be used if you need to retrieve more than 1000 organizations.

        <h2>Checkpoint Pagination</h2>

        To search by checkpoint, use the following parameters:
        <ul>
        <li><code>from</code>: Optional id from which to start selection.</li>
        <li><code>take</code>: The total number of entries to retrieve when using the <code>from</code> parameter. Defaults to 50.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Note</b>: The first time you call this endpoint using checkpoint pagination, omit the <code>from</code> parameter. If there are more results, a <code>next</code> value is included in the response. You can use this for subsequent API calls. When <code>next</code> is no longer included in the response, no pages are remaining.

        List organization members.
        This endpoint is subject to eventual consistency. New users may not be immediately included in the response and deleted users may not be immediately removed from it.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the <code>fields</code> parameter to optionally define the specific member details retrieved. If <code>fields</code> is left blank, all fields (except roles) are returned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Member roles are not sent by default. Use <code>fields=roles</code> to retrieve the roles assigned to each listed member. To use this parameter, you must include the <code>read:organization_member_roles</code> scope in the token.
          </li>
        </ul>

        This endpoint supports two types of pagination:

        - Offset pagination
        - Checkpoint pagination

        Checkpoint pagination must be used if you need to retrieve more than 1000 organization members.

        <h2>Checkpoint Pagination</h2>

        To search by checkpoint, use the following parameters: - from: Optional id from which to start selection. - take: The total amount of entries to retrieve when using the from parameter. Defaults to 50. Note: The first time you call this endpoint using Checkpoint Pagination, you should omit the <code>from</code> parameter. If there are more results, a <code>next</code> value will be included in the response. You can use this for subsequent API calls. When <code>next</code> is no longer included in the response, this indicates there are no more pages remaining.

        This endpoint supports two types of pagination:
        <ul>
        <li>Offset pagination</li>
        <li>Checkpoint pagination</li>
        </ul>

        Checkpoint pagination must be used if you need to retrieve more than 1000 organization members.

        <h2>Checkpoint Pagination</h2>

        To search by checkpoint, use the following parameters:
        <ul>
        <li><code>from</code>: Optional id from which to start selection.</li>
        <li><code>take</code>: The total amount of entries to retrieve when using the from parameter. Defaults to 50.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Note</b>: The first time you call this endpoint using checkpoint pagination, omit the <code>from</code> parameter. If there are more results, a <code>next</code> value is included in the response. You can use this for subsequent API calls. When <code>next</code> is no longer included in the response, no pages are remaining.

      summary: Revoke an SSO access ticket
      description: |
        Revokes an SSO access ticket and invalidates associated sessions. The ticket will no longer be accepted to initiate a Self-Service SSO session. If any users have already started a session through this ticket, their session will be terminated. Clients should expect a `202 Accepted` response upon successful processing, indicating that the request has been acknowledged and that the revocation is underway but may not be fully completed at the time of response. If the specified ticket does not exist, a `202 Accepted` response is also returned, signaling that no further action is required.
        Clients should treat these `202` responses as an acknowledgment that the request has been accepted and is in progress, even if the ticket was not found.

        Find users by email. If Auth0 is the identity provider (idP), the email address associated with a user is saved in lower case, regardless of how you initially provided it.

        For example, if you register a user as JohnSmith@example.com, Auth0 saves the user's email as johnsmith@example.com.

        Therefore, when using this endpoint, make sure that you are searching for users via email addresses using the correct case.

        Update a user.

        These are the attributes that can be updated at the root level:

        <ul>
            <li>app_metadata</li>
            <li>blocked</li>
            <li>email</li>
            <li>email_verified</li>
            <li>family_name</li>
            <li>given_name</li>
            <li>name</li>
            <li>nickname</li>
            <li>password</li>
            <li>phone_number</li>
            <li>phone_verified</li>
            <li>picture</li>
            <li>username</li>
            <li>user_metadata</li>
            <li>verify_email</li>
        </ul>

        Some considerations:
        <ul>
            <li>The properties of the new object will replace the old ones.</li>
            <li>The metadata fields are an exception to this rule (<code>user_metadata</code> and <code>app_metadata</code>). These properties are merged instead of being replaced but be careful, the merge only occurs on the first level.</li>
            <li>If you are updating <code>email</code>, <code>email_verified</code>, <code>phone_number</code>, <code>phone_verified</code>, <code>username</code> or <code>password</code> of a secondary identity, you need to specify the <code>connection</code> property too.</li>
            <li>If you are updating <code>email</code> or <code>phone_number</code> you can specify, optionally, the <code>client_id</code> property.</li>
            <li>Updating <code>email_verified</code> is not supported for enterprise and passwordless sms connections.</li>
            <li>Updating the <code>blocked</code> to <code>false</code> does not affect the user's blocked state from an excessive amount of incorrectly provided credentials. Use the "Unblock a user" endpoint from the "User Blocks" API to change the user's state.</li>
            <li>Supported attributes can be unset by supplying <code>null</code> as the value.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Updating a field (non-metadata property)</h5>
        To mark the email address of a user as verified, the body to send should be:
        <pre><code>{ "email_verified": true }</code></pre>

        <h5>Updating a user metadata root property</h5>Let's assume that our test user has the following <code>user_metadata</code>:
        <pre><code>{ "user_metadata" : { "profileCode": 1479 } }</code></pre>

        To add the field <code>addresses</code> the body to send should be:
        <pre><code>{ "user_metadata" : { "addresses": {"work_address": "100 Industrial Way"} }}</code></pre>

        The modified object ends up with the following <code>user_metadata</code> property:<pre><code>{
          "user_metadata": {
            "profileCode": 1479,
            "addresses": { "work_address": "100 Industrial Way" }
          }
        }</code></pre>

        <h5>Updating an inner user metadata property</h5>If there's existing user metadata to which we want to add  <code>"home_address": "742 Evergreen Terrace"</code> (using the <code>addresses</code> property) we should send the whole <code>addresses</code> object. Since this is a first-level object, the object will be merged in, but its own properties will not be. The body to send should be:
        <pre><code>{
          "user_metadata": {
            "addresses": {
              "work_address": "100 Industrial Way",
              "home_address": "742 Evergreen Terrace"
            }
          }
        }</code></pre>

        The modified object ends up with the following <code>user_metadata</code> property:
        <pre><code>{
          "user_metadata": {
            "profileCode": 1479,
            "addresses": {
              "work_address": "100 Industrial Way",
              "home_address": "742 Evergreen Terrace"
            }
          }
        }</code></pre>

    post:
      summary: Link a User Account
      description: |-
        Link two user accounts together forming a primary and secondary relationship. On successful linking, the endpoint returns the new array of the primary account identities.

        Note: There are two ways of invoking the endpoint:

        <ul>
          <li>With the authenticated primary account's JWT in the Authorization header, which has the <code>update:current_user_identities</code> scope:
            <pre>
              POST /api/v2/users/PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_USER_ID/identities
              Authorization: "Bearer PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_JWT"
              {
                "link_with": "SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_JWT"
              }
            </pre>
            In this case, only the <code>link_with</code> param is required in the body, which also contains the JWT obtained upon the secondary account's authentication.
          </li>
          <li>With a token generated by the API V2 containing the <code>update:users</code> scope:
            <pre>
            POST /api/v2/users/PRIMARY_ACCOUNT_USER_ID/identities
            Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_V2_TOKEN"
            {
              "provider": "SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_PROVIDER",
              "connection_id": "SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_ID(OPTIONAL)",
              "user_id": "SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_USER_ID"
            }
            </pre>
            In this case you need to send <code>provider</code> and <code>user_id</code> in the body. Optionally you can also send the <code>connection_id</code> param which is suitable for identifying a particular database connection for the 'auth0' provider.
          </li>
        </ul>
