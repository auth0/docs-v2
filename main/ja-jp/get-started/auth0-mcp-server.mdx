The Auth0 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server connects AI agents to your Auth0 tenant, allowing them to perform complex, multi-step operations in Auth0 such as creating applications, managing users, or deploying Actions. It leverages the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), a standardized protocol that enables AI agents to communicate with external tools and APIs to execute tasks on your behalf.

Designed for developers who use AI-powered tools like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Desktop, the Auth0 MCP Server transforms how developers manage their identity infrastructure, making it faster and easier to work with Auth0 services.

## Authentication and credential security

Auth0 MCP Server prioritizes robust security by managing authentication, validating requests, and ensuring secure communication with the Auth0 <Tooltip data-tooltip-id="react-containers-DefinitionTooltip-0" href="/ja-jp/glossary?term=management-api" tip="Management API: 顧客が管理タスクを実行できるようにするための製品。" cta="用語集の表示">Management API</Tooltip>. This includes:

* [OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow](/ja-jp/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/device-authorization-flow): Securely authenticates requests with Auth0.
* [Secure credential storage](/ja-jp/get-started/applications/rotate-credentials): Credentials are securely stored in your system's keychain and never exposed in plain text.
* [Minimal API permissions](/ja-jp/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens): Only essential permissions are requested, adhering strictly to the principle of least privilege.
