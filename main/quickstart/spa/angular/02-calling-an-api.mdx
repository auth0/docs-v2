Visit the [Integrate Angular with an API Server](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/guides/spa/angular/basic-authentication#integrate-angular-with-an-api-server) section of the [Angular Authentication By Example](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/guides/spa/angular/basic-authentication) guide for a deep dive into calling a protected API from Angular. This guide allows you to set up a sample API server using a backend technology of your choice, effectively creating a full-stack application.

The focus of this guide is to show you how to configure the SDK to call APIs protected by OAuth 2. Instead of creating a demo API to test the client-server connection, you'll use the [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api#management-api), which comes bundled with your Auth0 tenant. However, you can adapt this guide to work with any API that you are securing with Auth0.

This article builds upon [the previous chapter](/quickstart/spa/angular-next), adding the capability to automatically attach an access token to outgoing requests made using Angular's built-in `HttpClient` service.

If you followed the [previous section where you added user log in to Angular](/quickstart/spa/angular-next#add-login-to-your-application), make sure that you log out of your application as you'll need a new access token to call APIs.

## Provide the HTTP Interceptor

To install and configure the HTTP interceptor, perform the following steps:

* Import the `authHttpInterceptorFn` type from the Auth0 Angular SDK
* Import `provideHttpClient` from `@angular/common/http`
* Register `authHttpInterceptorFn` in `provideHttpClient` using `withInterceptors`.
* Add configuration to specify audience, scope, and which requests should have an `Authorization` header attached automatically

The following is an example of an Angular module (based upon the default implementation when you create a new app using `ng new`) that supports `AuthHttpInterceptor`, configured to call the Auth0 Management API with the ability to read the current user profile:

To begin, open your `app.module.ts` file and add the necessary imports at the top:

```javascript lines
// Import the injector module and the HTTP client module from Angular
import { provideHttpClient, withInterceptors } from '@angular/common/http';

// Import the HTTP interceptor from the Auth0 Angular SDK
import { authHttpInterceptorFn } from '@auth0/auth0-angular';
```






Next, add `provideHttpClient` to the `providers` of the `bootstrapApplication` function, and add `authHttpInterceptorFn` using `withInterceptors`:

```js lines
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authHttpInterceptorFn])),
  ]
});
```






Finally, modify the configuration given to `provideAuth0()` to specify the `audience` and `scope` values required by the API you want to call, as well as the API routes that should be intercepted by `authHttpInterceptorFn`.

In this case, the audience and scope for the Auth0 Management API are given, which allows your app to retrieve information about the current user.

```js lines
provideAuth0({
  // The domain and clientId were configured in the previous chapter
  domain: '{yourDomain}',
  clientId: '{yourClientId}',

  authorizationParams: {
    redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
    
    // Request this audience at user authentication time
    audience: 'https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/',

    // Request this scope at user authentication time
    scope: 'read:current_user',
  },

  // Specify configuration for the interceptor              
  httpInterceptor: {
    allowedList: [
      {
        // Match any request that starts 'https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/' (note the asterisk)
        uri: 'https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/*',
        tokenOptions: {
          authorizationParams: {
            // The attached token should target this audience
            audience: 'https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/',

            // The attached token should have these scopes
            scope: 'read:current_user'
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
})
```






As Auth0 can only issue tokens for custom scopes that exist on your API, ensure that you define the scopes used above when [setting up an API](https://auth0.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-api) with Auth0.

Please [refer to the docs](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular/blob/main/EXAMPLES.md#configure-authhttpinterceptor-to-attach-access-tokens) for more information on the available options for the HTTP interceptor.

## Make an API Call

With your app module configured with the HTTP interceptor from the Angular SDK, calls you make using Angular's built-in `HttpClient` to the Auth0 Management API will have the appropriate access token specified in the `Authorization` header. Let's use this as an example for showing user metadata.

The following component demonstrates how to display the `user_metadata` field from the authenticated user's profile, by making a call to the `/api/v2/users` endpoint using `HttpClient`:

```js lines
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { concatMap, tap, map } from 'rxjs/operators';

// Import the HttpClient for making API requests
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

// Import AuthService from the Auth0 Angular SDK to get access to the user
import { AuthService } from '@auth0/auth0-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-metadata',
  template: `<div *ngIf="metadata">
    <pre>{{ metadata | json }}</pre>
  </div>`,
  standalone: true,
})
export class UserMetadataComponent implements OnInit {
  metadata = {};

  // Inject both AuthService and HttpClient
  constructor(public auth: AuthService, private http: HttpClient) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.auth.user$
    .pipe(
      concatMap((user) =>
        // Use HttpClient to make the call
        this.http.get(
          encodeURI(`https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/users/${user?.sub}`)
        )
      ),
      map((user: any) => user.user_metadata),
      tap((meta) => (this.metadata = meta))
    )
    .subscribe();
  }
}
```






This call succeeds because the HTTP interceptor took care of making sure the correct access token was included in the outgoing request.

### Checkpoint

Your application will show an empty JSON object if you have not set any `user_metadata` for the logged-in user. To further test out this integration, head to the [Users section of the Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users) and click on the user who is logged in. Update the `user_metadata` section with a value like `{ "theme": "dark" }` and click "Save". Refresh your Angular application and verify that it reflects the new `user_metadata`.

Please refer to the [Auth0 API quickstarts](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend) to learn how to integrate Auth0 with your backend platform.
