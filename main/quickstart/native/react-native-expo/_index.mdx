    This Quickstart is for the Expo framework. To integrate Auth0 into your React Native application, please refer to
        the React Native Quickstart.

    <Info>
    This SDK is not compatible with "Expo Go" app. It is compatible only with Custom Dev Client and EAS
                  builds.
    </Info>

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1" isSingleColumn>
      To use Auth0 services, you need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
            where you will configure authentication in your project.

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that represents
            the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID
            that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your Application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/), which is where you can
            manage your Applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample application instead.

      ### Configure callback and logout URLs

      Auth0 invokes the callback and logout URLs to redirect users back to your application. Auth0 invokes the callback
            URL after authenticating the user and the logout URL after removing the session cookie. If you do not set the
            callback and logout URLs, users will not be able to log in and out of the app, and your application will produce
            an error.

      Add the corresponding URL to **Callback URLs** and **Logout URLs**, according to your app's platform. If
            you are using a custom domain, use the value of your custom
            domain instead of your Auth0 tenantâ€™s domain.

      In this section, you will learn how to install the React Native Auth0 module.

      <Info>
      Please refer to the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for additional details on React Native.

      <Info>
      For further reference on `yarn`, check their [official documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs).

      ### npm

      <AuthCodeBlock icon="file-code" language="bash">
      AUTH0_SECRET='use [openssl rand -hex 32] to generate a 32 bytes value'

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3" isSingleColumn>
      The Auth0 package runs custom native code that must be configured at build time. Use [Expo Config
              Plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/config-plugins/) to achieve this.

      The `react-native-auth0` plugin will be added in the [Expo config](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/).
    
    <App />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4" isSingleColumn>
      You must generate the native code for the above configuration to be set. To do this, run the following command:

      <AuthCodeBlock icon="file-code" language="bash">
      AUTH0_SECRET='use [openssl rand -hex 32] to generate a 32 bytes value'
      APP_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
      AUTH0_DOMAIN='https://{USER_DOMAIN}'
      AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='{USER_CLIENT_ID}'
      AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='{USER_CLIENT_SECRET}'
      </AuthCodeBlock>

      You will be prompted to provide the [Android package](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/android-package.md) and [iOS
              bundle identifier](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/bundle-identifier.md) if they are not already present in the Expo config.

      <AuthCodeBlock icon="file-code" language="bash">
      AUTH0_SECRET='use [openssl rand -hex 32] to generate a 32 bytes value'
      APP_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
      AUTH0_DOMAIN='https://{USER_DOMAIN}'
      AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='{USER_CLIENT_ID}'
      AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='{USER_CLIENT_SECRET}'
      </AuthCodeBlock>


      These values are used to set the callback and logout URLs.

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5" isSingleColumn>
      The `useAuth0` hook relies on a React Context to provide state management. This context is provided by
            the `Auth0Provider` component.

      Import the `useAuth0` hook and `Auth0Provider` component from the
            `react-native-auth0` package:

      <AuthCodeBlock icon="file-code" language="jsx" lines="true">
      AUTH0_SECRET='use [openssl rand -hex 32] to generate a 32 bytes value'
      APP_BASE_URL='http://localhost:3000'
      AUTH0_DOMAIN='https://{USER_DOMAIN}'
      AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='{USER_CLIENT_ID}'
      AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='{USER_CLIENT_SECRET}'
      </AuthCodeBlock>


      For the SDK to function properly, you must wrap your application in the `Auth0Provider` component, and
            set the following properties:

      - `domain`: The domain of your Auth0 tenant. Generally, you can find this in the Auth0 Dashboard
                under your Application's **Settings** in the **Domain** field. If you are using a custom domain, you should set this to the value of your
                custom domain instead.
      - `clientId`: The client ID of the Auth0 Application you set up earlier in this quickstart. You can
                find this in the Auth0 Dashboard under your Application's **Settings** in the **Client ID** field.

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Your `Auth0Provider` component should now be properly configured. Run your application to
                    verify that:

      - the SDK is initializing correctly
      - your application is not throwing any errors related to Auth0
      </Note>
    
    <App3 />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6" isSingleColumn>
      Authenticate the user by calling the `authorize` method provided by the `useAuth0` hook.
            This redirects the user to the Auth0 Universal Login page
            for authentication, then back to your app.

      For confirmation that the user was logged in successfully, check that the `user` property provided by
            the hook is not `null`.

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button component that calls `authorize` when clicked. Verify that you are redirected to
                    the login page and then back to your application.
      </Note>
    
    <App4 />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[6].id} title={sections[6].title} stepNumber="7" isSingleColumn>
      To log the user out, redirect them to the Auth0 logout endpoint by calling `clearSession`. This will
            remove their session from the authorization server and log the user out of the application.

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a logout button that calls `clearSession` and observe that you are redirected to the Auth0
                    logout endpoint and back again. You should no longer be logged in to your application.
      </Note>
    
    <App5 />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[7].id} title={sections[7].title} stepNumber="8" isSingleColumn>
      The `useAuth0` hook exposes a `user` object that contains information about the
            authenticated user. You can use this to access user profile information about the authenticated user that has been
            decoded from the [ID token](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/id-tokens).

      If a user has not been authenticated, this property will be `null`.

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Log in and inspect the `user` property on the result. Verify the current user's profile
                    information, such as `email` or `name`.
      </Note>
    
    <App6 />
</Section>

    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
