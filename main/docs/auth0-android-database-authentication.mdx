<Warning>

Username/Email & Password authentication from native applications is disabled by default for new tenants as of 8 June 2017. Users are encouraged to use Universal Login and perform Web Authentication instead. If you still want to proceed you'll need to enable the Password Grant Type on your dashboard first. See [Application Grant Types](/docs/get-started/applications/application-grant-types) for more information.

</Warning>

## Log in with a database connection

To log in with a database connection, call `login` with the user's **email**, **password**, and the **connection** you want to authenticate with. The response is a `Credentials` object.

```kotlin lines
authentication
    .login("username@domain.com", "a secret password", "my-database-connection")
    .start(object: Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
        override fun onSuccess(payload: Credentials) {
            // Logged in!
        }

        override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
            // Error!
        }
    })
```

The default scope is `openid profile email`.

## Sign up with a database connection

To sign up with a database connection, call the `signUp` method, passing the user's email, password, and connection name.

```kotlin lines
authentication
    .signUp("username@domain.com", "a secret password", "my-database-connection")
    .start(object: Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
        override fun onSuccess(result: Credentials) {
            // Signed Up & Logged in!
        }

        override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
            // Error!
        }
    });
```
