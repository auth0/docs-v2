description: 'Auth0 exposes the following APIs for developers to consume in their applications.'
---

### Auth API

The Authentication API exposes identity functionality for Auth0 and supported identity protocols (including OpenID Connect, OAuth, and SAML).

Typically, you should consume this API through one of the Auth0 SDKs, such as Auth0.js, or a library like Lock. However, if you are building your authentication UI manually, you will need to call the Authentication API directly.

Some example tasks include:
- Get tokens during authentication
- Request a user's profile using an Access Token
- Exchange Refresh Tokens for new Access Tokens
- Request a challenge for multi-factor authentication (MFA)

### Management API

The Management API allows you to manage your Auth0 account programmatically, so you can automate configuration of your environment. Most of the tasks you can perform in the Auth0 Management Dashboard can also be performed programmatically by using this API.

Some example tasks include:
- Register your applications and APIs with Auth0
- Set up connections with which your users can authenticate
- Manage users

### My-Account API

My Account API allows you to perform user context operations in context of a logged in user.

Some example tasks include:
- Manage authentication factors
- Setup & manage MFA factors

### My-Organization API

My Organization API allows you to perform organization context operations in context of a logged in organization administrator or via a backend service.

Some example tasks include:
- Setup & manage an organization
- Setup & manage identity providers
- Invite & manage organization members
