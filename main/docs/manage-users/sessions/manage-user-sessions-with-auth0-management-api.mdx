Auth0 uses [sessions](/docs/manage-users/sessions) to maintain the authentication state of a user across requests.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

The Auth0 Management API session management endpoints are available to customers on Enterprise plans. To learn more, read [Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing).

</Callout>

## Management API endpoints

The [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) provides out-of-band access to the internals of user sessions in the [Auth0 Session Layer](/docs/manage-users/sessions/session-layers), and deletion methods to force session termination.

### Session resource

You can view or delete a specific session with the following endpoints:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Name</strong></th>
<th><strong>URL</strong></th>
<th><strong>Required scope(s)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Introspect a specific session by ID</td>
<td><code>GET /api/v2/sessions/{sessionId}</code></td>
<td><code>read:sessions</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delete a specific session by ID</td>
<td><code>DELETE /api/v2/sessions/{sessionId}</code></td>
<td><code>delete:sessions</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### User resource

You can list or delete all sessions for a given user with the following endpoints:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Name</strong></th>
<th><strong>URL</strong></th>
<th><strong>Required scope(s)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>List sessions details of a user</td>
<td><code>GET /api/v2/users/{userId}/sessions</code></td>
<td><code>read:sessions</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delete all user sessions</td>
<td><code>DELETE /api/v2/users/{userId}/sessions</code></td>
<td><code>delete:sessions</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Session properties

The session endpoints return relevant information about the session and its history.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Field</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Session ID</td>
<td>The session ID is a persistent identifier of the session in the Auth0 tenant.<br/><br/>Note that the session ID corresponds to the <code>sid</code> claim already in ID Tokens and Logout Tokens and can be used to cross-reference these entities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Relevant Time</td>
<td>Session creation, authentication time, and expiry information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Device Information</td>
<td>The device property traces details related to the user agent (for example, browser) used in the interactions with this Auth0 session.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Authentication Information</td>
<td>Contains summary information about the methods used to authenticate in this session.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For detailed information about these fields, refer to the [Management API documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

## OIDC Back-Channel Logout Initiators

Session deletion events are connected to [OIDC Back-Channel Logout](/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout) through the `session-deleted` initiator. To learn more, read [OIDC Back-Channel Logout Initiators](/docs/authenticate/login/logout/back-channel-logout/oidc-back-channel-logout-initiators).

## Sessions and refresh tokens

Sessions and <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=refresh+tokens">refresh tokens</Tooltip> collaborate to reduce the friction of user authentication while optimizing security. To learn more, read [Best Practices for Application Session Management on Auth0 Blog](https://auth0.com/blog/application-session-management-best-practices).

Refresh tokens can remain active after a session has expired or been deleted, or after the user logs out. You can use the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> to [manage refresh tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/manage-refresh-tokens-with-auth0-management-api) independently or in collaboration with sessions.

## Limitations

Delete session operations run asynchronously, and are eventually consistent.
