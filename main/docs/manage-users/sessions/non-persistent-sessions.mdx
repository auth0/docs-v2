In persistent sessions, users close a browser, but retain the session when re-opening the browser on the same device. To enhance the user experience and provide more secure access, non-persistent sessions invalidate a <Tooltip tip="Session Cookie: Entity that, when present, allows the user to be considered authenticated." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=session+cookie">session cookie</Tooltip> when the browser is closed.

<Warning>

Biometrics as a First Factor authentication type will not work with non-persistent sessions.

</Warning>

## Browser Limitations

In some cases, non-persistent sessions **cannot** be enforced by tenant settings. Examples include:

* The user has a session restore setting on the browser enabled; restoring the session also restores the session cookie.
* The user closes a tab but not the browser window; the session cookie is not cleared until the session ends based on Idle or Absolute Expiration.

In these instances, non-persistent sessions do **not** provide extra security to the session.

## Sessions

Sessions consist of a cookie on the browser and a session record on the server. In non-persistent sessions, cookies are not persisted, and a tenant timeout is set, so users don’t have to manually log out of a device.

Session lifetime determines how long the system should keep the login session and is configured per tenant. TheAbsolute Expiration of a session is defined when the session is created. You can enable non-persistedsettings for user sessions, or allow the session to continue even if the browser is closed. You can adjust the Absolute Expiration and non-persisted settings in the Dashboard or the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>. To learn more, read [Configure Session Lifetime Settings](/docs/manage-users/sessions/configure-session-lifetime-settings).

## Cookies

The Auth0 platform uses three types of cookies: session, <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Multi-Factor+Authentication">Multi-Factor Authentication</Tooltip>, and device. All of these change to non-persistent once your Auth0 tenant is configured. The tenant timeout triggers the session expiration.

When non-persistent sessions are enabled, the following cookies will be issued as session cookies when interacting with the <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a user’s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+server">authorization server</Tooltip>:

* `auth0` / `auth0_compat`
* `auth0-mf` / `auth0-mf_compat`
* `did` / `did_compat`

To learn more about cookies, read [Authentication API Cookies](/docs/manage-users/cookies/authentication-api-cookies).

## Tenant configuration

You can configure your tenant to handle sessions in one of two ways:

* **Persistent**: session cookies persist when the browser is closed.
* **Non-Persistent**: session cookies do not persist. The browser retains session cookies until the browsing session is over. To learn more, read [HTTP State Management Mechanism on IETF Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2109/).

To configure these settings in the Dashboard:

1. Go to [Dashboard > Tenant Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant), and select the **Advanced** view.
2. Scroll to the **Session Expiration** section, locate **Idle Session Lifetime** and **Maximum Session Lifetime**, enter the desired settings, and select **Save.**

## Management API

You can use the Management API to enable non-persistent sessions as well as set values for session lifetime, idle session lifetime, and properties for sessions cookies. To learn more, review the [Management API Tenant Update endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tenants/patch-settings).
