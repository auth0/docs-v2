All users associated with a single Auth0 tenant are shared between the tenant's applications (and therefore have access to the applications).

* To keep users separate and restrict their access, we recommend that you [create an additional tenant](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants/create-multiple-tenants) with applications you want groups of users to access.

* To restrict users' access to certain applications, you can use [rules](/docs/customize/rules).

  + Inside a rule, the `context.clientName` and `context.clientID` variables are available to check which application the user is using for login.
  + See [this rule for an example](https://github.com/auth0/rules/blob/aeaf93bc058408e260192d0941a688963449d6be/src/rules/simple-user-whitelist-for-app.js).

* To restrict users from applications by configuring a new connection and only giving access to a specific application.

  + Go to [Dashboard > Authentication > Social](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social) and click on a connection.
  + On the **Applications** tab, enable/disable applications.

* To disable users' access to your applications, you can [block and unblock users](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/block-and-unblock-users) in the Dashboard.
