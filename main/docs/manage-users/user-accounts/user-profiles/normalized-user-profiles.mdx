title: Normalized User Profiles
  user profile.

The normalized user profile is an Auth0-specific way of standardizing and storing user-related information. Because every <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Identity+Provider">Identity Provider</Tooltip> (IdP) provides a different set of information about a user, Auth0 normalizes common profile properties into a protocol-agnostic representation of the user when storing user-related claims. For example, `family_name` in the normalized user profile contains details that may be returned to an IdP as `surname` or `last_name`.

As such, the Auth0 claims included in the normalized user profile differ from the standard set of claims that can be returned in <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+Tokens">ID Tokens</Tooltip> from the [Authentication API's `oauth/token` endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-token) or in the response from the [`/userinfo`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#user-profile) endpoint (both of which follow the requirements detailed in the OIDC specification).

To learn about the attributes included in the normalized user profile and understand how you can work with them, read [User Profile Structure](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/user-profile-structure).
