Auth0's normalized user profile contains a number of root attributes (attributes stored at the first, or root, level of the object), some of which may be updated. To learn more about the user profile structure and its attributes, read [User Profile Structure.](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/user-profile-structure)

Methods for updating root attributes vary depending on connection type.

## Auth0 as the identity provider

When Auth0 is the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Identity+Provider">Identity Provider</Tooltip> (IdP), subscribers may:

* Set root attributes [on user sign-up](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/set-root-attributes-user-signup) (via the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> or via public signup)
  or [on import](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/set-root-attributes-user-import)
* [Update root attributes individually](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) via the Management API

Auth0 is the IdP for the following connection types:

* [Regular database connections](/docs/authenticate/database-connections)
* [Custom database connections](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db) with import mode
* [Passwordless connections](/docs/authenticate/passwordless)

## Upstream identity providers

When an upstream IdP (like Google or Facebook) is used, subscribers have two options:

* The upstream IdP sets the root attributes when users are first created and then
  automatically updates them with each subsequent login. This is the default behavior.
* The upstream IdP sets the root attributes on user creation only and does not
  update them on subsequent logins, thereby allowing subscribers to [update root attributes individually](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) via the Management API. To enable this, you will need to [configure your connection sync with Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/connections/configure-connection-sync).

Upstream Identity Providers handle the following connection types:

* [Social connections](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers#social)
* [Enterprise connections](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers#enterprise)
* [Legal identity connections](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers#legal-identities)
