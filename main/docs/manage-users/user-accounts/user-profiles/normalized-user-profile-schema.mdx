The attributes that Auth0 maps to a common schema are listed below.

Fields that are always generated:

* `name`: the user's full name.
* `nickname`: by default, the local part of the user's email.
* `picture`: the URL of the [user's picture](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/change-user-picture). If unavailable, Auth0 uses the Gravatar image associated with the user's email address.
* `user_id`: the user's unique identifier. This is unique per Connection, but the same for all apps that authenticate via that Connection.

By default, a user's `name`, `nickname`, and `picture` attributes provided by <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+providers">identity providers</Tooltip> other than Auth0 (such as Google, Facebook, or X) are not directly editable since they are updated from the identity provider each time a user logs in. If you want to be able to edit these attributes, you must [configure your connection sync with Auth0](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) so that user attributes will be updated from the identity provider only on user profile creation. Root attributes will then be available to be [edited individually](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) or [by bulk import](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) using the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.

Fields that are generated when the details are available:

* `email`: the user's email address.
* `email_verified`: a boolean indicating if the user's email address has been verified.
* `given_name`: the user's first name.
* `family_name`: the user's last name.

When creating a user with the [Create a User Management API endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_users) you can submit the `given_name` and `family_name`. By default, a user's `given_name` and `family_name` attributes provided by identity providers other than Auth0 (such as Google, Facebook, or X) are not directly editable since they are updated from the identity provider each time a user logs in. If you want to be able to edit these attributes, you must [configure your connection sync with Auth0](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) so that user attributes will be updated from the identity provider only on user profile creation. Root attributes will then be available to be [edited individually](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) or [by bulk import](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) using the Management API

If you are writing a login script for a [custom database](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db) you are responsible for returning the information in the user profile. A unique and immutable `user_id` property is mandatory to correctly identify the user (see [Uniquely Identify Users](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/identify-users)).

## Additional Attributes

The User Profile includes an array of identities. In the most common case (logging in with a single provider), the array contains only one element. If the user has multiple accounts linked, the array will have an element for each associated account. See [User Account Linking](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking) for more information.

The `identities` array contains the following attributes:

* `connection`: the name of the connection.
* `isSocial`: indicates if the provider is a Social provider.
* `provider`: the provider of the connection.
* `user_id`: the unique identifier of the user for this connection.

Auth0 passes all other properties supplied by the identity provider to your app, even if they are not mapped to the standard attributes listed above.
