In addition to using the Dashboard, you can retrieve, create, update or delete users using the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users). If you want to call the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> directly, you will first need to generate the appropriate <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip>. To learn more, read [Access Tokens for the Management API](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens). Alternatively, you can use an SDK to implement the functionality you need to call the Management API from your application. For a list of available SDKs, read [the SDKs section of our Support Matrix](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/product-support-matrix).

To learn how to manage <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> access for your team members, read [Manage Dashboard Access](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access).

## Permissions

Use the following permissions to get an access token for the machine-to-machine applications. To learn more, read [Register Machine-to-Machine Applications.](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/machine-to-machine-apps)

<table class="table"><thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>read:users</code></td>
<td>Applications can search and retrieve any user records stored in an Auth0 tenant. This includes reading via the <code>/api/v2/users</code> , <code>/api/v2/users-by-email</code>, and <code>/api/v2/jobs/users-export</code> endpoints.</td>

<td><code>create:users</code></td>
<td>Applications can create users in any database or passwordless connection in an Auth0 tenant. This includes creating via the <code>/api/v2/users</code> and <code>/api/v2/jobs/users-import</code> endpoints.<br/><br/> The <code>/api/v2/users</code> endpoint also requires the client ID to be added to the <code>enabled_clients</code> property of the connection, similar to the <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#signup">sign-up endpoint</a>.</td>

<td><code>update:users</code></td>
<td>Applications can update any user stored in an Auth0 tenant. This includes updating via the <code>/api/v2/users</code> endpoint.</td>

</tr>

<td><code>delete:users</code></td>
<td>Applications can delete any user stored in an Auth0 tenant. This includes deleting via the <code>/api/v2/users</code> endpoint.</td>

## Limitations

By default, user profile attributes provided by <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+providers">identity providers</Tooltip> other than Auth0 (such as Google, Facebook, or X) are not directly editable because they are updated from the identity provider each time the user logs in. Fore more information on attributes from identity providers, read [Configure Identity Provider Connection for User Profile Updates](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0).

To be able to edit the `name`, `nickname`, `given_name`, `family_name`, or `picture` root attributes on the normalized user profile, you must [configure your connection sync with Auth0](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) so that user attributes will be updated from the identity provider only on user profile creation. These root attributes will then be available to be edited individually or by bulk imports

You can set passwords using the `create` or `update` endpoints, but for security purposes, passwords cannot be viewed with the `get` or `list user` commands. The right side of the API explorer provides hints on the user profile attributes which can be viewed or modified for any given call.

## Endpoints

* Use the [`/users`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/get-users) endpoint to [retrieve information about all users](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/get-users). You can also include search criteria to find specific users.
* Use the [`/user_id`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/get-users-by-id) to [retrieve information about one user](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/get-users-by-id) based on the `user_id`. The `user_id` is an internal identifier that consists of a connection name and a unique identifier for the user. The `user_id` is different from the <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+token">ID token</Tooltip>.
* The [`/userinfo`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/reference#get-user-info) endpoint takes as input the [Auth0 access token and returns user profile information](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/reference#get-user-info). This endpoint will include the results of any rules that may have altered the user profile during the authentication transaction, but the resulting user profile will not be filtered by any [Scoping](/docs/get-started/apis/scopes/api-scopes).
* The [`/tokeninfo`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/reference#get-token-info) endpoint takes as input the [Auth0 ID token and returns user profile information](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/reference#get-token-info). This endpoint will return a result that does not include the results of any rules that alter the user profile.
