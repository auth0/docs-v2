User search allows you to retrieve user profile details using Auth0's [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2). Search results can be [viewed](/docs/manage-users/user-search/view-search-results-by-page), [sorted](/docs/manage-users/user-search/sort-search-results), and [exported](/docs/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-exports).

Most user profile fields are not returned as part of an [ID Token](/docs/secure/tokens/id-tokens), nor are they included in the response from the [`/userinfo` endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-user-info) of the Authentication API.

When searching for users in Auth0, you can use multiple endpoints to search for ID, email, or other criteria:

## Search Result Terminology

We use the following terms to describe the user search results:

* **Eventually consistent**: Search results may not reflect a recently-completed write operation. However, if you repeat your request after a short period of time, the response will return up-to-date data.
* **Immediately consistent**: Search results will reflect the results of all successful write operations, including those that occurred shortly prior to your request.
