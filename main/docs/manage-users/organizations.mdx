<Card title="Availability varies by Auth0 plan">

Both your specific login implementation and your Auth0 plan or custom agreement affect whether this feature is available. To learn more, read [Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing).

The Organizations feature represents a broad update to the Auth0 platform that allows our business-to-business (B2B) customers to better manage their partners and customers, and to customize the ways that end-users access their applications and APIs. Auth0 customers can use Organizations to:

* Represent their business customers and partners in Auth0 and manage their membership.
* Configure branded, federated login flows for each business.
* Offer machine-to-machine access for their business customers and partners to consume their B2B APIs.
* Build administration capabilities into their products, using Organizations APIs, so that those businesses can manage their own organizations.
