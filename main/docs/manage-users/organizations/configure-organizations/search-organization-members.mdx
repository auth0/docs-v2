In addition to [listing organization members](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/retrieve-members), you can use [User Search](/docs/manage-users/user-search) to find users filtered by organization membership by using the `organization_id` parameter in a search.

For example, below is a filter for users that have an `acme.com` email domain but are not members of the Acme organization:

`email.domain:"acme.com" AND NOT organization_id:"ACME_ORG_ID"`

The following finds all users that are in the Acme organization and log in with a specific database connection.

`organization_id:"ACME_ORG_ID" AND identities.connection:"my-db-connection-name"`

The example below finds users whose email addresses start with jane and are members of the Acme organization.

`organization_id:"ACME_ORG_ID" AND email:jane*`

See [User Search](/docs/manage-users/user-search) for more details.
