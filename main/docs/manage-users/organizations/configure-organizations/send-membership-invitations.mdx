You can send [organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations/organizations-overview) membership invitations to users using either the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> or the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.

## Auth0 Dashboard

To invite members via the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Organizations](https://manage.auth0.com/#/organizations), and select the organization for which you want to configure membership.
2. Select the **Invitations** view, and select **Invite Members**.
3. Select the Application to which you would like to invite the member, enter the email address of the user you would like to invite to the organization, and select **Send Invite(s)**.

   Optionally, you can specify the connection with which you want users to accept the invitation, and roles you want assigned to the organization member when they accept.

   </Callout>

If you enable [Multiple Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains/multiple-custom-domains), you have the option to select **Domain** under the **Send Invite(s)** section to select the notification domain for your tenant.

## Management API

<Warning>

If you are exposing the invitation feature from an admin dashboard you have customized for your application, use a [confidential application](/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications) to validate the authenticated user belongs to an organization before inviting new members, or you can restrict users from inviting new members unless they are assigned a specific role.

</Warning>

To invite members via the Management API:
Make a `POST` call to the Create Organization Invitations endpoint. Be sure to replace `ORG_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `NAME_OF_USER`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CONNECTION_ID`, `EXP_TIME`, `ROLE_ID`, and `SEND_INVITATION_EMAIL_OPTION` placeholder values with your organization ID, Management API <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip>, name of invited user, email address of invited user, <Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+ID">client ID</Tooltip>, connection ID, expiration time, and role IDs, respectively.

```json lines
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/api/v2/organizations/ORG_ID/invitations",
"headers": [
  { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
  { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
  { "name": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
  ],
  "postData": {
  "mimeType": "application/json",
  "text" : "{ \"inviter\": { \"name\": \"NAME_OF_USER\"}, \"invitee\": { \"email\": \"EMAIL_ADDRESS\" }, \"client_id\": \"CLIENT_ID\", \"connection_id\": \"CONNECTION_ID\", \"ttl_sec\": \"EXP_TIME\", \"roles\": [ \"ROLE_ID\", \"ROLE_ID\", \"ROLE_ID\" ], \"send_invitation_email\": \"SEND_EMAIL_INVITATION_OPTION\" }"
  }
}
```

If you enable [Multiple Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains/multiple-custom-domains), you need to include the `auth0-custom-domain` HTTP header. To learn more, review [Multiple Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains/multiple-custom-domains#customize-email-handling-using-the-management-api).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

**Find Your Auth0 Domain**

If your Auth0 domain is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `travel0`, your Auth0 domain name would be `travel0.us.auth0.com`. (If your tenant were in the US and created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://travel0.auth0.com`.)

If you are using custom domains, this should be your custom domain name.
