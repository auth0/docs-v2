title: Grant Just-In-Time Membership to an Organization Connection
---
Granting just-in-time membership allows users that log in via an enabled connection to automatically be given membership to an [organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations/organizations-overview).

To automatically grant membership when users log in to an organization, you must first [configure and enable a connection](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/enable-connections) for the organization. While enabling your connection, select **Enable Auto-Membership** to allow all users logging in with the connection to be automatically added as members of this organization.
