[Auth0 Support](https://support.auth0.com) can help you integrate with external logging services if you need to retain logs beyond your retention time. This approach is also useful for aggregating logs across your organization.

In addition, you can use Auth0 log streaming to export log data. To learn more, navigate to [Log Streaming](https://marketplace.auth0.com/features/log-streaming) in Auth0 Marketplace.
