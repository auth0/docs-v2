The Private Cloud packages are managed services that you can use if you:

* Cannot use a multi-tenant Public Cloud service in your organization
* Have geographical deployment requirements where the Public Cloud option isn't feasible
* Require a guaranteed level of requests per second (RPS) or higher capacity than available on Public Cloud

The Auth0 private cloud can be deployed in the following ways:

<table class="table"><thead>

<td>A dedicated, managed cloud service running on AWS providing isolation, higher performance, dev instances, Geo-HA add-ons and more</td>
