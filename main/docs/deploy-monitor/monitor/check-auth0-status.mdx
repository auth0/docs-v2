Go to the [Auth0 Public Cloud Status](https://status.auth0.com) page to check the service availability of the public cloud version of Auth0.

Select a **Region** from the dropdown menu to see the status of Core Services (such as User Authentication and Machine-to-Machine Authentication) and Supporting Services (such as <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip>, <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>, Tenant Logs, and CDN).

For more information on available regions, refer to the [Region, locality, and sub-locality](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants#region-locality-and-sub-locality) table in [Create Tenants](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants).

## Subscribe to Public Cloud status updates

Select a **Region**, and then select **Subscribe** to get updates. You can choose from two options to view status:

1. Follow [@auth0status](https://twitter.com/auth0status) on X to get the latest status updates.
2. Subscribe to the Auth0 Atom or RSS feed to get status updates that affect your tenant. Replace `{YOUR_TENANT_DOMAIN}` with your tenant's **Domain**.

To find your tenant's **Domain**, go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/#/applications), select an application, and then go to **Settings**. Your tenant's **Domain** is listed under **Basic Information**.

## Check Auth0 status for Private Cloud

Go to the [Auth0 Public Cloud Status](https://status.auth0.com), and then select **Private Cloud Login**.

Once authenticated, you can see the status of any non-development environment (for example, `travel0-prod-1`) if it's available on the Auth0 Converged Platform.

For more information, please read [Open and Manage Support Tickets](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/open-and-manage-support-tickets) and [Manage Dashboard Access](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access).
