Auth0 provides logs that you can analyze for your business needs. You can:

* View actions performed by tenant administrators.
* View operations performed via the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.
* View authentications made by your users.
* View intermittent errors that may be hard to find with quality assurance testing.
* Capture forensic data for security purposes and to identify anomaly detection triggers.
* Identify patterns in usage trends.
* Check for authentication errors and Management API call errors.
* Set up automatic log scanning to check for rate limit errors so that you can proactively address activity that hits rate limits before it impacts your users.
* Correlate management API events to their initiating requests by matching `X-Correlation-ID` header values.
