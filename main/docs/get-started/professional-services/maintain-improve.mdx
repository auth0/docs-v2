title: 'Professional Services: Maintain and Improve'

Once complete, we can work with your teams to review your identity environment, optimize and improve your solution, advise on new features, and answer any questions; all of these services are designed to help you maintain and improve on your Auth0 investment. To support this we recommend scheduling an annual HealthCheck engagement with Professional Services via one of our Maintain and Improve packages.

For larger customers, we also provide our "Premier Success" post-implementation consulting service via our Maintain and Improve packages. This assigns a dedicated Solutions Architect to meet with your team on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis to provide you with the ongoing assistance a demanding environment can often require.

We provide continuous education and knowledge transfer throughout any engagement. If any part of your project requires more specialized attention and/or implementation assistance, or you would like some specialized training, then your Auth0 Solution Architect will be happy to help you understand how additional Professional Services can help you further to reach your goal.
