## Programming advisory

Focused on accelerating your development team’s understanding of Auth0 SDKs, APIs, extensibility and integration points, our Programming Advisory services give you the opportunity to engage with our team to get best practice guidance on a wide range of topics. We can provide your development teams with code samples and programming guidance that will help you integrate with Auth0 faster and more effectively, whatever your chosen language or technology stack. Delivered through a number of our Discover, Design, & Implement packages.

## Deployment preparation

Provides for validation on an implemented solution, typically prior to go-live. Our Deployment Preparation services primarily focus on review of integration, including usage of the Auth0 SDKs, APIs, and extensibility as well as setup configuration of Auth0 and Auth0 Tenant. We can provide you with the peace of mind that the systems you deploy will be safe and secure. Delivered via a number of our Discover, Design, & Implement packages.

## Custom implementation

In addition, our Custom Implementation services -- delivered as part of a number of our Discover, Design, & Implement packages -- provide a wide range of customized implementations to help you accelerate your integration with Auth0. Custom Implementation gives you the opportunity to leverage our implementation services in cases where you need more than the standard out-of-box functionality:

* **Custom Actions, Rules, Hooks, database scripts, login pages and email templates**: Solve user experience, third-party service integration, or other logical problem within a customer’s Auth0 authentication and authorization workflow. These customizations happen in-product and do not require additional infrastructure to deploy.
* **Custom APIs and libraries**: Solve service communication, user experience, or tenant management problem through the use of a custom web services endpoint or code library. Typically deployed on customer or third-party infrastructure.
* **Custom utilities**: Solve quality assurance or operations problems that are out-of-band from extending core product functionality, such as performance testing or deployment scripts.
