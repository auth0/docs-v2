As an Auth0 tenant administrator, you are responsible for all activities that occur under your Auth0 account and tenants including managing your tenant members. You can add, change, and remove tenant members (dashboard users) in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> or from the [Auth0 Teams Dashboard](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/tenant-member-management). Auth0 recommends that you periodically review the list of Auth0 Dashboard tenant members with access to your Auth0 tenant and make sure that:

* Each person has a legitimate need for tenant member access.
* Members are registered with a company account.
* Former employees no longer have access.
* There's more than one Dashboard admin.
