In this document we covered a simple scenario involving an API used by a Single-Page Application (SPA) to allow employees to capture their timesheets.

We learned about the Implicit Grant, what an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip> is, how to configure an API in Auth0, how to configure a SPA application to communicate securely with this API, how to define and secure our API endpoints, how to use the provided libraries to validate the Access Token and how to retrieve a new one from Auth0.

We started by describing the business case and the requirements and went on explaining how each requirement can be met and the thought process behind each choice that was made.

We used Node.js for the API implementation and Angular for the SPA. Hopefully though after going through this document you are able to build this using the technologies you prefer.
