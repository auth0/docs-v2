This guidance is relevant to **all** project stakeholders. We recommend reading it in its entirety at least once, even if you've already started your journey with Auth0. We provide a Project Planning Guide in PDF format, details about how to get started with each phase of the implementation process, and checklists to help you manage the tasks in each phase.

There are many different ways Auth0 can be integrated into the B2B IAM project architecture. Auth0's flexibility comprehensively supports many different use cases however your project may not require all of the capabilities provided by Auth0. Knowing what, when, and how best to implement something will help you focus on completing the necessary tasks at the right time.

## Project Planning Guide

We provide planning guidance in PDF format that you can download and refer to for details about our recommended strategies.

## Multiple Organization Architecture (Multitenancy)

Many B2B platforms implement some form of isolation and/or branding for their customers' organization, and this can add complexity to any Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. If this applies to you, then we recommend you take some time to read through our guidance and best practice advice for this type of environment.

## Get started

Customers using Auth0 for Business-to-Business (B2B) projects typically share a common set of goals and objectives, and in the sections that follow we'll focus on our real-world customer implementation experiences to help you deliver your solution efficiently.
