title: Light and Dark themes
---
Auth0 customers can use light mode or dark mode in their tenant Dashboard. You can also set your Dashboard to use the same settings as your local system environment.

There are two ways to change your Dashboard theme:

1. Select the profile dropdown menu at the top-right of your Dashboard.
2. Use the menu to switch between themes.

You may also click **Your Profile** in the same dropdown and scroll to the bottom, where you can choose from the three themes.
