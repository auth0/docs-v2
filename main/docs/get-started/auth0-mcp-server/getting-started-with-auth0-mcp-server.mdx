<Card title="Before you start">

* Install [Node.js v18 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your system.
* Create an active [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/)with administrative permissions.
* Install at least one supported MCP client ([Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads), or [Windsurf](https://www.windsurf.com/editor), for example).

</Card>

Empower your team and your users by installing [Auth0 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](/docs/get-started/auth0-mcp-server) and integrating with several commonly-used [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## Installation and configuration

Install Auth0 MCP Server by running one of these commands in your terminal:

### For Claude Desktop (default)

```bash lines
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init
```






### For Cursor

```bash lines
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --client cursor
```






### For Windsurf

```bash lines
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init --client windsurf
```






### Other MCP clients

To use Auth0 MCP Server with any other MCP Client, you can manually add this configuration to the client and restart for changes to take effect:

```json lines
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "auth0": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@auth0/auth0-mcp-server", "run"],
      "capabilities": ["tools"],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "auth0-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Begin a conversation with Claude Desktop and ask help managing your Auth0 tenant.

### Cursor

1. Restart Cursor to ensure it recognizes the newly installed Auth0 MCP Server.
2. In Cursor, open **Settings > MCP** and verify that **Auth0** appears in the **MCP Servers** list.
3. Begin a conversation with Cursor and ask for help managing your Auth0 tenant.

### Windsurf

1. Restart Windsurf to ensure it recognizes the newly installed Auth0 MCP Server.
2. In Windsurf, open **Windsurf Settings > Cascade** and verify that **Auth0** appears in the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** list.

Most connection issues can be resolved by configuring the Auth0 MCP server and restarting the MCP client.

</Callout>

#### Get command line help:

View a list of supported commands and usage examples with:

```bash lines
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server help
```






#### Authentication issues

Ensure correct permissions in your Auth0 tenant and try re-initializing with:

```bash lines
npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server init
```






#### Connection failures:

1. Confirm the MCP server is actively running with:

   ```ps lines
   ps aux | grep auth0-mcp
   ```


   

   
2. Restart your AI client after verifying the server is running.

#### Claude Can't Connect to the Server error:

1. Restart Claude Desktop after installation.
2. Check that the server is running with:

   ```ps lines
   ps aux | grep auth0-mcp
   ```


   

   

#### API errors:

Check your Auth0 token permissions and expiration. Enable debug mode (see below) to view detailed logs.

## Debug configuration issues

#### Enable debug mode

Enable debug mode to view detailed logs:

```bash lines
export DEBUG=auth0-mcp
```






#### Debug client logs

Get detailed MCP client logs from Claude Desktop:

```bash lines
# Follow logs in real-time
tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```






Get detailed MCP server logs by running the Auth0 MCP Server in debug mode:

```bash lines
DEBUG=auth0-mcp npx @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run
```






#### Advanced debugging using MCP Inspector

For advanced troubleshooting, use the MCP Inspector:

```bash wrap lines
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e DEBUG='auth0-mcp' @auth0/auth0-mcp-server run__text in bold__
```
