The term **application** or **app** in Auth0 does not imply any particular implementation characteristics. For example, it could be a native app that executes on a mobile device, a single-page application that executes on a browser, or a regular web application that executes on a server.

Auth0 categorizes apps based on these characteristics:

* **Application type**: To add authentication to your application, you must register it in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> and select from one of the following application types:

  + **Regular web application**: Traditional web apps that perform most of their application logic on the server (such as Express.js or ASP.NET). To learn how to set up a regular web application, read [Register Regular Web Applications](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps).
  + **Single page web application (SPA)**: JavaScript apps that perform most of their user interface logic in a web browser, communicating with a web server primarily using APIs (such as AngularJS + Node.js or React). To learn how to set up a Single-page web application, read [Register Single-Page Web Applications](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps).
  + **Native application**: Mobile or Desktop applications that run natively on a device (such as iOS or Android). To learn how to set up a native application, read [Register Native Applications](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/native-apps).
  + **Machine to machine (M2M) application**: Non-interactive applications, such as command-line tools, daemons, IoT devices, or services running on your backend. Typically, you use this option if you have a service that requires access to an API. To learn how to set up a native application, read [Register Machine-to-Machine Applications](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/machine-to-machine-apps).
* **Credential security**: According to the [OAuth 2.0 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1), apps can be classified as either public or confidential; confidential apps can hold credentials securely, while public apps cannot. To learn more, read [Confidential and Public Applications](/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications).
* **Ownership**: Whether an app is classified as first- or third-party depends on app ownership and control. First-party apps are controlled by the same organization or person that owns the Auth0 domain. Third-party apps enable external parties or partners to securely access protected resources behind your API. To learn more, read [First-Party and Third-Party Applications](/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications/first-party-and-third-party-applications).

## Manage applications settings

You register applications in [Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings). In addition to setting up applications in the Dashboard, you can also set up applications programmatically as described in the [OpenID Connect (OIDC) Dynamic Client Registration 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html)  specification.

You can set up a more complex configuration that allows users to log in differently for different apps. To learn more, read [Multi-Tenant Application Best Practices](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants/multi-tenant-apps-best-practices) and [Create Multiple Tenants](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants/create-multiple-tenants).

By default, Auth0 enables all connections associated with your tenant when you create a new application. To change this, [update application connections](/docs/get-started/applications/update-application-connections) in the **Application Settings** in the Dashboard.

## Monitor applications

You can [monitor apps](/docs/deploy-monitor/monitor/monitor-applications) and perform end-to-end testing using your own tests. Auth0 stores [log data](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs) including Dashboard administrator actions, successful and failed user authentications, and password change requests. You can use log streaming in [Auth0 Marketplace](https://marketplace.auth0.com/features/log-streaming) to export your log data and use tools like Sumo Logic, Splunk, or Mixpanel to analyze and store your log data.

## Remove applications

You can [remove an application](/docs/get-started/applications/remove-applications) using the Dashboard or the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.

## Manage client secrets

A <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a userâ€™s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+secret">client secret</Tooltip> is a secret known only to your application and the <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+server">authorization server</Tooltip>. It protects your resources by only granting [tokens](/docs/secure/tokens) to authorized requestors.

Protect your client secrets and **never** include them in mobile or browser-based apps. If your client secret is ever compromised, you should [rotate to a new one](/docs/get-started/applications/rotate-client-secret) and update all authorized apps with the new client secret.

## Grant types

Auth0 provides many different authentication and authorization grant types or flows and allows you to indicate which grant types are appropriate based on the `grant_types` property of your Auth0-registered app. To learn more, read [Application Grant Types](/docs/get-started/applications/application-grant-types).
