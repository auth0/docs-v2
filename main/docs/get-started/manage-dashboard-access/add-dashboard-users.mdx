If you are a tenant administrator, you can add colleagues to the tenant and assign them a specific role to allow them access to the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> features they need.

<Warning>

If your tenant administrator account authenticates with username and password, you must verify your email address before you can invite other members.

</Warning>

If Teams is provisioned for your enterprise account, manage your tenant members via Auth0 Teams. To learn more, read [Team Member Management](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/team-member-management).

</Callout>

When you add new tenant members, you can assign roles that allow them access without putting production applications and sensitive information at risk. You can assign a user more than one role and the permissions will be combined. For further protection, users can turn on [multi-factor authentication](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/add-change-remove-mfa) (<Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip>). To learn more about which Dashboard features are accessible with each role, read [Dashboard Access by Role](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role).

<Card title="Availability varies by Auth0 plan">

Both your specific login implementation and your Auth0 plan or custom agreement affect whether this feature is available. To learn more, read [Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing).

</Card>

1. Go to [Dashboard > Settings > Tenant Members](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/admins).
2. Click **Add Member**.
3. On the **Add New Tenant Member** screen, enter the user's email address and select the roles you would like to assign to them.
4. Click **Invite**.
   Auth0 will send an email to the user with a link for them to click to accept the invitation. Before the user accepts the invitation, they will appear in the Invitations list as pending. If you click the `...` you will see **Remove invitation** or **Copy invitation link**.

<Card title="Missing tenants">

Users can create Auth0 accounts in different ways. For example, they can sign up with a social provider (e.g., Google, GitHub), then sign up again using their email address. If your tenant members cannot see all of their tenants after logging in, check to see if they have multiple Auth0 accounts. You can view the signup method used by the Dashboard tenant member by going to [Dashboard > Tenant Settings > Tenant Members](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/admins).

</Card>

When the invited user clicks the link to accept the invitation, they will be asked to log in with the invited email address. They can then choose whether to log in with a social provider or to log in with their email address and password. If they choose to log in with their email address and password, they must have already created an account with Auth0, or they will need to sign up first and then accept the invitation again.
