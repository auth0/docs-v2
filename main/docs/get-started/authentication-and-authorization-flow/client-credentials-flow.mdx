The Client Credentials Flow (defined in [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) involves an application exchanging its application credentials, such as <Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+ID">client ID</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+secret">client secret</Tooltip>, for an <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip>.

This flow is best suited for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications, such as CLIs, daemons, or backend services, because the system must authenticate and authorize the application instead of a user.

## How it works

1. Application sends application's credentials to the Auth0 Authorization Server. To learn more about client authentication methods, read [Application Credentials](/docs/secure/application-credentials).
2. Auth0 Authorization Server validates application's credentials.
3. Auth0 Authorization Server responds with an access token.
4. Application can use the access token to call an API on behalf of itself. For more information on this process, see [Validate JSON Web Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/validate-json-web-tokens).
5. API responds with requested data.

## How to implement it

The easiest way to implement the Client Credentials Flow is to follow our [Backend Quickstarts](/docs/quickstart/backend).

Alternatively, you can use the Auth0 Authentication API to implement the Client Credentials Flow. For more information, readÂ [Call Your API Using the Client Credentials Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow/call-your-api-using-the-client-credentials-flow).
