The Authorization Code Flow (defined in [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)), involves exchanging an authorization code for a token.

This flow can only be used for confidential applications (such as Regular Web Applications) because the application's authentication methods are included in the exchange and must be kept secure.

## How Authorization Code Flow works

1. User selects **Login** within application.
2. Auth0's SDK redirects user to Auth0 Authorization Server ([`/authorize`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/authorization-code-flow/authorize-application) endpoint).
3. Auth0 Authorization Server redirects user to login and authorization prompt.
4. User authenticates using one of the configured login options, and may see a consent prompt listing the permissions Auth0 will give to the application.
5. Auth0 Authorization Server redirects user back to application with single-use authorization code.
6. Auth0's SDK sends authorization code, application's client ID, and application's credentials, such as client secret or Private Key JWT, to Auth0 Authorization Server ([`/oauth/token`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/authorization-code-flow/get-token) endpoint).
7. Auth0 Authorization Server verifies authorization code, application's client ID, and application's credentials.
8. Auth0 Authorization Server responds with an ID token and access token (and optionally, a refresh token).
9. Application can use the access token to call an API to access information about the user.
10. API responds with requested data.

## How to implement Authorization Code Flow

The easiest way to implement the Authorization Code Flow is to follow our [Regular Web App Quickstarts](/docs/quickstart/webapp).

Alternatively, you can use the Authentication API to implement the Authorization Code Flow. For more information, read [Add Login Using the Authorization Code Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/add-login-auth-code-flow) or [Call Your API Using the Authorization Code Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/call-your-api-using-the-authorization-code-flow).

If a browser application, with an Origin header, makes a `POST` request to the `/oauth/token` endpoint, Auth0 doesn’t issue refresh tokens, even if the application has [Allow Refresh Token Rotation](/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/configure-refresh-token-rotation) enabled and sends the [offline_access](/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/configure-refresh-token-rotation#configure-with-the-auth0-spa-sdk) scope.
