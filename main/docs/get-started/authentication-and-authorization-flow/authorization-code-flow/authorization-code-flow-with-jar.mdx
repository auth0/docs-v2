To use Highly Regulated Identity features, you must have an Enterprise Plan with the Highly Regulated Identity add-on. Refer to [Auth0 Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing/) for details.

[JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9101) is an extension of the OAuth2 protocol and adds a layer of security to protect the integrity of authorization request parameters.

## Prerequisites

To use JAR, you must first [generate an RSA key pair](/docs/secure/application-credentials/generate-rsa-key-pair). Then, register the public key with Auth0 as explained in [Configure JWT-Secured Authorization Requests](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-jar).

During the authorization code flow, the client application takes the parameters they would like to send to the `/authorize` or `/oauth/par` endpoints and wraps them in a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens), which they then sign using the private key.

The <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a user’s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+server">authorization server</Tooltip> verifies the signature with your application's public key. If the signature is valid, the authorization server extracts the request parameters from JAR and processes the request as usual. As a result, the parameter values are guaranteed to come from a known source, and cannot be tampered with or accessed by intermediaries.

## Generate the JAR request

To generate a JAR request, you need to first create a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens). Use the [Auth0 JWT library](https://jwt.io/libraries) to help you generate a <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip> in your preferred language.

### Header

For a JAR request, the JWT header must contain the following fields:

* `alg`: The algorithm used to sign the JWT. Must be either RS256, RS384, or PS256.
* `typ`: The type of JWT. Must be either `jwt` or `oauth-authz-req+jwt`.

The header may also contain a `kid` field that identifies the key used to sign the JWT. If a `kid` is present, Auth0 will look for a public key registered during [JAR configuration](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-jar) that has a matching key ID and use that key to verify the JWT’s signature.

### Payload

The JWT payload must contain the following claims:

* `iss`: This must contain your app’s `client_id`
* `aud`: This must be your tenant’s domain, with the protocol and a trailing forward slash. For example, `https://your_domain.auth0.com/`

The JWT must also contain any mandatory parameters for the call to `/authorize`. For example:

* `client_id`: This must also contain your app’s `client_id`
* `response_type`: Indicates to Auth0 which <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth+2.0">OAuth 2.0</Tooltip> flow you want to perform. Use `code` for Authorization Code Grant Flow.

The JWT may contain any of the optional parameters for the <Tooltip tip="Authorization Flow: Authorization grant (or workflow) specified in the OAuth 2.0 framework." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+flow">authorization flow</Tooltip> that is being requested, such as `audience`, `scope`, `state`, `redirect_uri`, among others.

In addition, the JWT may contain the following optional claims:

* `iat`: Must be a numeric date.
* `nbf`: Must be a numeric date, representing a time in the past.
* `exp`: Must be a numeric date, representing a time in the future.
* `jti`: Must be a string no longer than 64 bytes.

### Generate JWT example

The following JavaScript code sample demonstrates how to build and sign a JWT using JavaScript and the [jsonwebtoken library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken?activeTab=readme). It outputs the generated JWT to the console:

```javascript lines expandable
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const crypto = require("crypto");
const fs = require('fs');

const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('[PATH TO YOUR PEM FILE]');
const client_id = '[YOUR CLIENT ID]';
const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');

const requestObject = jwt.sign(
{
  iss: client_id,    
  aud: 'https://your_tenant.auth0.com/', // your tenant's domain
  client_id,
  response_type: "code",
  scope: "openid profile",
  redirect_uri : "https://myapp.com/callback" // your app's callback URL
  nonce
},
privateKey,
{
  keyid: '[YOUR KID]', // optional key id (kid) value from your public key
  algorithm: 'RS256',
  header: {
    typ: 'oauth-authz-req+jwt',
  },
});

console.log(requestObject);
```






### Call the authorization endpoint

To call the `/authorize` endpoint using your signed JWT, open a new browser window. Pass your <Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+ID">Client ID</Tooltip> as the `client_id` parameter and the signed and URL-encoded JWT as the `request` parameter.

```bash lines
# MacOS
open "https://your_tenant.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=[YOUR CLIENT ID]&request=[URL ENCODED JWT]"

# Windows
explorer "https://your_tenant.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=[YOUR CLIENT ID]&request=[URL ENCODED JWT]"
```
