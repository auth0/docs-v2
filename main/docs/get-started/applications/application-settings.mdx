## Basic settings

When you edit an existing application's settings or create a new application, you enter information about the application in the **Settings** view.

### Basic Information

<Frame>![Dashboard Applications Application Settings Tab Basic Information](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/2GPUw7BODYuYYH3658Upz3/92a49ec57e6b4d07be96093989baac03/2023-04-11_15-34-58.png)</Frame>

* **Name**: The name of your application. Editable, and will be seen in the portal, emails, logs, and so on.
* **Domain**: Your Auth0 tenant name. You choose this when you create a new Auth0 tenant, and it cannot be changed. If you need a different domain, you must register for a new tenant by selecting **+ Create Tenant** in the top-right menu.
* **<Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+ID">Client ID</Tooltip>**: The unique identifier for your application. You will use this when configuring authentication with Auth0. Generated by the system when you create a new application and cannot be modified.
* **<Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+Secret">Client Secret</Tooltip>**: A string used to sign and validate <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+Tokens">ID Tokens</Tooltip> for authentication flows and to gain access to select Auth0 API endpoints. By default, the value is hidden, so check the **Reveal Client Secret** box to see it. While the Client ID is considered public information, the Client Secret **must be kept confidential**. If anyone can access your Client Secret, they can issue tokens and access resources they shouldn't be able to access.
* **Description**: A free-text description of the Application's purpose. Maximum of 140 characters.

### Application Properties

<Frame>![Dashboard Applications Application Settings Tab Application Properties](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/4Z66jnQOVFwNo5iuHtdlxo/153fabafccac939aa15c23a65ba974cb/Application_Properties_-_English.png)</Frame>

* **Application Logo**: The URL of a logo (recommended size: 150x150 pixels) to display for the application. Appears in several areas, including the list of applications in the Dashboard and customized consent forms. If none is set the default badge for this type of application will be shown.
* **Application Type**: The Auth0 application type determines which settings you can configure using the Dashboard. (Not editable for M2M apps. Sometimes disabled for other Auth0 application types if the selected grant types are only allowed for the currently selected application type.) Use the drop-down to select from the following types:

  + [Machine to Machine](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/machine-to-machine-apps): Non-interactive applications, such as command-line tools, daemons, IoT devices, or services running on your backend. Typically, you use this option if you have a service that requires access to an API.
  + [Native App](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/native-apps): Mobile or Desktop applications that run natively in a device (such as iOS or Android).
  + [Regular Web App](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps): Traditional web apps that perform most of their application logic on the server (such as Express.js or ASP.NET).
  + [Single Page App](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps): JavaScript apps that perform most of their user interface logic in a web browser, communicating with a web server primarily using APIs (such as AngularJS + Node.js or React).

### Application URIs

<Frame>![Dashboard Applications Application Settings Application URIs](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/1QhW2i4fTCCp8owey2tMPI/a19f7fc3f84118920d0e5cb2357144da/Application_URIs.png)</Frame>

* **Application Login URI**: In some scenarios, Auth0 will need your application to redirect to your application's login page. This URI needs to point to a route in your application that redirects to your tenant's `/authorize` [endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#authorize-application). It would usually take the form of `https://myapp.org/login`. To learn more, read [Configure Default Login Routes](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/configure-default-login-routes).
* **Allowed Callback URLs**: Set of URLs to which Auth0 is allowed to redirect users after they authenticate. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them (typically, to handle different environments like QA or testing). For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard [placeholder for subdomains](/docs/get-started/applications/wildcards-for-subdomains) (`*.google.com`).
  If you are using the Organizations feature, for production applications, you can use `{organization_name}` as a placeholder to dynamically specify a registered organizationâ€™s name in a URL (`https://{organization_name}.exampleco.com`). URLs with the `{organization_name}` placeholder should only be used on domains that you fully control (for example, `https://{organization_name}.exampleco.com` where you control the `exampleco.com` domain).

  Do not use wildcard placeholders or localhost URLs in your application callbacks or allowed origins fields. Using redirect URLs with wildcard placeholders can make your application vulnerable to attacks. To learn more, read [Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet on owasp.org](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet). Instead, URLs with the `{organization_name}` placeholder should be preferred, where relevant. To learn more, read [Subdomain URL Placeholders](/docs/get-started/applications/wildcards-for-subdomains).
* **Allowed Logout URLs**: After a user logs out from Auth0 you can redirect them with the `returnTo` query parameter. The URL that you use in `returnTo` must be listed here. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard placeholder for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Notice that query strings and hash information are not taken into account when validating these URLs. See [Logout](/docs/authenticate/login/logout). You can provide up to 100 URLs in the **Allowed Logout URLs** field.
* **Allowed Web Origins**: List of URLs from where an authorization request using [Cross-Origin Authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/cross-origin-authentication), [Device Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/device-authorization-flow), and `web_message` as the response mode can originate from. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard placeholder for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Paths, query strings, and hash information are not taken into account when validating these URLs (and may, in fact, cause the match to fail). You can provide up to 100 URLs in the **Allowed Web Origins** field.

### ID Token

In the **ID Token** section, enter the **ID Token Expiration** (in seconds) which is the amount of time before the Auth0 `id_token` expires. The default value is 36000 seconds which is 10 hours.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

**Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign-on**: If enabled, this setting prevents Auth0 from redirecting authenticated users with valid sessions to the identity provider (such as Facebook or ADFS). **Legacy tenants only.**

</Callout>

### Refresh Token Rotation

In the **<Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Refresh+Token">Refresh Token</Tooltip> Rotation** section, enable or disable rotation. When enabled, as a result of exchanging a refresh token, a new refresh token will be issued and the existing token will be invalidated. This allows for automatic detection of token reuse if the token is leaked. In addition, enter the **Rotation Overlap Period** (in seconds). This interval is the allowable leeway time that the same `refresh_token` can be used to request an `access_token` without triggering automatic reuse detection. To learn more, read [Refresh Token Rotation](/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/refresh-token-rotation).

### Refresh Token Expiration

In the **Refresh Token Expiration** section, enable or disable absolute and inactivity expiration and set the lifetimes (in seconds) for each. To learn more, read [Configure Refresh Token Expiration](/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/configure-refresh-token-expiration).

<Frame>![Dashboard Applications Applications Settings Tab Refresh Token Expiration](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/2EnpIEc4kBxjnS3T67xPzC/22fdb95e2a2f31cee6f01e02d0a709c2/Refresh_Token_Expiration_-_English.png)</Frame>

## Advanced settings

The **Advanced Settings** section allows you to:

* Manage or add application metadata, device, <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth">OAuth</Tooltip>, and WS-Federation settings
* Obtain certificates and <Tooltip tip="Token Endpoint: Endpoint on the Authorization Server that is used to programmatically request tokens." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Token+endpoint">Token endpoint</Tooltip> information
* Set the grant type(s) for the application

### Application Metadata

Application metadata are custom string keys and values (each of which has a character maximum of 255), set on a per-application basis. Metadata is exposed in the application object as `client_metadata`, and in rules as `context.clientMetadata`. You can create up to 10 sets of metadata.

### Device Settings

If you're developing a mobile application, enter the necessary iOS/Android parameters.

* When developing iOS apps, you'll provide your **Team ID** and **App ID**. To learn more, read [Enable Universal Links Support in Apple Xcode](/docs/get-started/applications/enable-universal-links-support-in-apple-xcode).
* When developing Android apps, you'll provide your **App Package Name** and your **Key Hashes**. To learn more, read [Enable Android App Links Support](/docs/get-started/applications/enable-android-app-links-support).

<Frame>![Dashboard Applications Application Settings Tab Advanced Settings Device Settings Tab](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/YKKPtWtswHn2FZGFSVWNw/086b32e41b3fd446ac8aa678be33648d/Device_Settings_-_EN.png)</Frame>

### OAuth

<Frame>![Dashboard Applications Application Settings Tab Advanced Settings OAuth Tab](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/5bbq6VrI9tUMht0PwMimre/08574482efef944b16ecfbb445be50ab/Oauth_Tab_-_English.png)</Frame>

* By default, all apps/APIs can make a delegation request, but if you want to explicitly grant permissions to selected apps/APIs, you can do so in **Allowed Apps/APIs**.
* For customers using the Highly Regulated Identity add-on, use the **Compliance Enforcement Level** setting to set your level of compliance. For more information, review [Configure FAPI Compliance](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-fapi-compliance).
* Set the algorithm used ([**HS256**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) or [**RS256**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)) for signing your <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JSON+web+tokens">JSON web tokens</Tooltip>. To learn more, read [JSON Web Token Signing Algorithms](/docs/get-started/applications/signing-algorithms). When selecting `RS256` (recommended), the token will be signed with your tenant's private key.
* Toggle the **Trust Token Endpoint IP Header** setting; if this is enabled, the `auth0-forwarded-for` is set as trusted and used as a source of end user IP information for protection against brute-force attacks on the Token endpoint. This setting is only available for Regular Web Apps and M2M Apps.
* Toggle the switch to indicate if your application is **OIDC Conformant** or not. Applications flagged as OIDC Conformant will strictly follow the OIDC specification.

For troubleshooting help, read [Troubleshoot Invalid Token Errors](/docs/troubleshoot/basic-issues/invalid-token-errors).

### Grant Types

Select grant types to enable or disable for your application. Available grant types are based on the application type.
