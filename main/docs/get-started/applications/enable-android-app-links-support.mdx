[Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) allow an application to designate itself as the default handler of a given type of link. For example, clicking a URL in an email would open the link in the designated application. This guide will show you how to enable Android App links support for your Auth0-registered application using Auth0's Dashboard.

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications), and select the name of the application to view.

2. Scroll to the bottom of the **Settings** page, and select **Show Advanced Settings**.
3. Select **Device Settings**, provide the [App Package Name](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id) and the SHA256 fingerprints of your appâ€™s signing certificate for your Android application, and select **Save Changes**.

You can use the following command to generate the fingerprint using the Java keytool in your terminal:
`keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore`

To learn more about signing certificates, see Android's [Sign Your App](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html) developer documentation.

## Test link

1. Navigate to the following URL in your browser: `https://{yourDomain}/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
2. If the link is successful, you will return the following JSON (formatted for readability):

   ```json lines
   [{
     "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
     "target": {
       "namespace": "android_app",
       "package_name": "com.mycompany.app1",
       "sha256_cert_fingerprints":
       ["14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5"]
     }
   }]
   ```
