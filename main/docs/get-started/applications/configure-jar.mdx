To use Highly Regulated Identity features, you must have an Enterprise Plan with the Highly Regulated Identity add-on. Refer to [Auth0 Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing/) for details.

<Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip>-Secured Authorization Requests (JAR) allow OAuth2 authorization request parameters to be packaged into a single JWT request parameter which is then signed for integrity protection.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring your application for using JAR, you must [generate an RSA key pair](/docs/secure/application-credentials/generate-rsa-key-pair).

<Warning>

You should generate a separate key pair for each type of credential usage. For example, do not reuse the same key pairs for both JAR and Private Key JWT Authentication.

</Warning>

## Configure JAR for an application

You can configure JAR for an application with the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> and the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.

<Tabs><Tab title="Auth0 Dashboard">

Use the Auth0 Dashboard to configure your application to use JAR with previously generated RSA keys.

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications).
2. Select the application you want to use with JAR.
3. Select the **Application Settings** tab.
4. In the **Authorization Requests**Â section, enable **Require JWT-Secured Authorization Requests**.
5. If no credential is assigned and there are credentials available, you will be prompted to assign an existing credential.

6. You will also have the option to assign a new credential.

7. Add and assign a new credential by uploading a previously generated RSA key pair. When prompted, enter the following:

   * **Name**: a name to identify the credential
   * **Public Key**: public key of the X.509 certificate in PEM format
   * **Algorithm**: select the JAR signature algorithm
   * **Expiration Date**: set the expiration date of the credential

</Tab><Tab title="Management API">

Use the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) to configure JAR for your application using the `signed_request_object` client configuration property. This object property contains the following fields:

* `required`: forces all authorization requests to the `/authorize` and `/oauth/par` to use JAR. To learn more, read [Authorization Code Flow with JWT-Secured Authorization Requests](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-jar) and [Authorization Code Flow with PAR and JAR](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-par-and-jar).
* `credentials`: an array of credential IDs used to verify signatures.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

The credentials parameter behaves similarly to the Private Key JWT parameter `client_authentication_methods.private_key_jwt.credentials` which supports credential creation when you create a new application. To learn more, read [Configure Private Key JWT](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-private-key-jwt).

</Callout>

You can configure JAR for a new application or for an existing application via the Management API.

#### Configure JAR for a new application

When you create a new application, configure JAR by sending a POST request with the `signed_request_object`. In that POST request, you can also register the corresponding client credential (i.e. the key PEM):

```json lines
POST https://{yourTenant}.auth0.com/api/v2/clients
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR ACCESS TOKEN]
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "My App using JAR",
  "signed_request_object": {
      "required": true,
"credentials": [{
        "name": "My credential for JAR",
        "credential_type": "public_key",
        "pem": "[YOUR PEM FILE CONTENT]",
        "alg": "RS256"
}]
  },
  "jwt_configuration": {
    "alg": "RS256"
  }
}
```






#### Configure JAR for an existing application

When updating an existing application, you need to explicitly create a client credential first. The following POST request uses your PEM file content to create your client credentials for JAR:

{/* codeblockOld.header.login.logInButton codeblockOld.header.login.configureSnippet */}


```json lines
POST https://{yourTenant}.auth0.com/api/v2/clients/{yourClientId}/credentials
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR ACCESS TOKEN]
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "My credentials for JAR",
  "credential_type": "public_key",
  "pem": "[YOUR PEM FILE CONTENT]",
  "alg": "RS256"
}
```






<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Make sure newlines are properly JSON-encoded with no additional formatting.

</Callout>

Then, assign the client credential to the `signed_request_object` client configuration. The following PATCH request associates your client credentials with the `signed_request_object`:

{/* codeblockOld.header.login.logInButton codeblockOld.header.login.configureSnippet */}


```json lines
PATCH https://{yourTenant}.auth0.com/api/v2/clients/{yourClientId}
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR ACCESS TOKEN]
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "signed_request_object": {
    "credentials": [{"id": "[YOUR CREDENTIAL ID]"}]
  }
}
```
