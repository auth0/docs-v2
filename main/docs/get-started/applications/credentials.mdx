On the [Applications](http://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) page of the Dashboard, locate your application in the list, and click its name to view the available settings. Switch to the **Credentials** tab.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

The Credentials tab may not be visible in your tenant if you have a public application. To learn more about confidential applications versus public applications, read [Confidential and Public Applications](/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications).

## Authentication Methods

Auth0 offers the following ways your application can authenticate with the <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a user’s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+server">authorization server</Tooltip>:

* **Private Key <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip>**: An asymmetric authentication method for confidential applications. In Private Key JWT, you generate a pair of keys, public and private, to use as credentials. You provide the public key and securely store the private key in your own system without sharing it with Auth0. You use the private key to sign the request sent to the authorization server. You can manage the public keys below in the **Available Credentials** section.
* **<Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+Secret">Client Secret</Tooltip>:** A symmetrical authentication method. In Client Secret authentication, you provide the Client Secret Auth0 assigned when you created the application. You can view and copy the `client_secret` directly from this section.

  + **Client Secret (Basic)**: Use Basic for a confidential application using the `HTTP BASIC` authentication scheme to send a Client Secret.
  + **Client Secret (Post)**: Use Post for a confidential application using request body parameters to send a Client Secret.

To learn more about authentication methods and associated credentials, read [Application Credentials](/docs/secure/application-credentials).

## Available Credentials

**Add New Credential**: Adds a new entry to the list if you have not reached the max number of credentials (2) for the application.

* **Name**: Name of the credential. For example: 4096.
* **Key ID**: Unique Auth0-generated credential identifier. The same credential can’t be uploaded more than once.
* **Algorithm**: Algorithm you select for each credential. We support RS256, PS256, and RS384.
* **Expires At**: `datetime` when the credential is invalid for the declared use. The credential will not be deleted, but will be inoperable. This can be configured in the UI by enabling the **Set an explicit expiry date for this credential** checkbox.

Choose the side menu to enable, disable, or delete credentials.
