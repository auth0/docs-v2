<Card title="Before you start">

* For security purposes, your application's origin URL must be listed as an approved URL. If you have not already added it to the **Allowed Callback URLs** for your application, you will need to add it to the list of **Allowed Origins (CORS)**.
* Ensure that **Allowed Web Origins** in your application's **Settings** view is set to the domain making the request. The URLs can contain wildcards for subdomains, but cannot contain relative paths after the domain URL. To learn more, read [Placeholders for Subdomains](/docs/get-started/applications/wildcards-for-subdomains).
* If you don't enable [Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains), you will need to create a verification page that uses Auth0.js as the fallback for the cross-origin authentication.

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows an application to load data (resource) from a domain (origin) that is different from the one that it's hosted on. A CORS policy is an explicit exception to the same-origin policy common to web applications.

For example, if you wanted your application (app.mydomain.com) to fetch a font from Google (fonts.google.com) in the background using Ajax, you would need to configure CORS.

## Configure cross-origin authentication

1. Go to [Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and click the name of the application to view.
2. Under **Cross-Origin Authentication**, toggle on **Allow Cross-Origin Authentication**.
3. Locate **Allowed Origins (CORS)**, and enter your application's origin URL. To learn more about Origins, read [Origin on Mozilla MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin).
4. Click **Save Changes**.

If you do not need to use CORS for your application, ensure that **Allow Cross-Origin Authentication** is toggled off.

## Create cross-origin verification page

There are some cases when third-party cookies will not be available. Certain browser versions do not support third-party cookies and, if they do, they may be disabled in a user's settings.

For [browsers that are supported](#browser-testing-support), you can use the `crossOriginVerification` method from the [Auth0.js SDK](/docs/libraries/auth0js) in your application on a dedicated page to handle cases when third-party cookies are disabled.

For browsers that are not supported, such as Chrome, Opera, and Safari, cross-origin authentication will not work when third-party cookies are disabled unless you enable [Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

**Safari's** configuration is labeled as "Prevent cross-site tracking" and uses [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/). Unfortunately, this also prevents third-party cookies from being useful in authentication scenarios. Here's an example of how it affects [token renewal](/docs/troubleshoot/authentication-issues/renew-tokens-when-using-safari).

</Callout>

1. Create a page in your application that instantiates `WebAuth` from [Auth0.js](/docs/libraries/auth0js). Call `crossOriginVerification` immediately. The name of the page is up to you.

   {/* codeblockOld.header.login.logInButton codeblockOld.header.login.configureSnippet */}


   ```text lines
   <!-- callback-cross-auth.html -->

   <head>
     <script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0/9.11/auth0.min.js"></script>
     <script type="text/javascript">
       var auth0Client = new auth0.WebAuth({
         clientID: '{yourClientId}',
         domain: '{yourDomain}'
       });
       auth0Client.crossOriginVerification();
     </script>
   </head>
   ```


   

   

   When third party cookies are not available, Auth0.js renders an iframe to call a different cross-origin verification flow.
2. Go to [Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications), and select the application to view.
3. Under **Cross-Origin Authentication**, add the URL of the callback page you created to the **Cross-Origin Verification Fallback URL** field.

   <Warning>

   For production environments, verify that the URL for the page does not point to `localhost`. The page must be in the same domain where the embedded login form is hosted and must have an `https` scheme.

   </Warning>
4. Click **Save Changes**.

For more details, view the [cross-origin authentication sample on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0/lock/blob/master/support/callback-cross-auth.html).

## Error codes and descriptions

<Warning>

Error descriptions are intended to be human-readable. They are subject to change at any time and should not be parsed by any code.

</Warning>

When Auth0.js v9 (and Lock) is used for embedded login, it calls the `/co/authenticate` endpoint, which has the following errors:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Status</strong></th>
<th><strong>Code</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>400</code></td>
<td><code>invalid_request</code></td>
<td>Invalid request body. All and only of client_id, credential_type, username, otp, realm are required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>400</code></td>
<td><code>unsupported_credential_type</code></td>
<td>Unknown credential type parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>400</code></td>
<td><code>invalid_request</code></td>
<td>Unknown realm non-existent-connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>401</code></td>
<td><code>unauthorized_client</code></td>
<td>Cross origin login not allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>401</code></td>
<td><code>password_leaked</code></td>
<td>This login attempt has been blocked because the password you're using was previously disclosed through a data breach (not in this application).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>403</code></td>
<td><code>access_denied</code></td>
<td>Wrong email or password.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>403</code></td>
<td><code>access_denied</code></td>
<td>Authentication error</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>403</code></td>
<td><code>blocked_user</code></td>
<td>Blocked user</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>429</code></td>
<td><code>too_many_attempts</code></td>
<td>Your account has been blocked after multiple consecutive login attempts. We've sent you a notification via your preferred contact method with instructions on how to unblock it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>429</code></td>
<td><code>too_many_attempts</code></td>
<td>We have detected suspicious login behavior and further attempts will be blocked. Please contact the administrator.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In addition, you can also get a generic `403` error without an `error` or `error_description` property. The response body would just include something similar to the following:

`Origin https://test.app is not allowed.`

## Browser testing support

The following browsers can use cross-origin authentication when third-party cookies are disabled:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer

<Card title="Samesite cookie attributes">

Previously, the [`samesite` cookie attribute](/docs/manage-users/cookies/samesite-cookie-attribute-changes) options were `true`, `false`, `strict` or `lax`. If you didn't set the attribute manually, Auth0 would use the default value of `false`.

Effective February 2020, Google Chrome v80 changed the way it handles cookies, and Auth0 implemented the following changes accordingly:

* Cookies without the `samesite` attribute set will be set to `lax`.
* Cookies with `sameSite=none` must be secured, otherwise they cannot be saved in the browser's cookie jar.

The goal of these changes are to improve security and help mitigate cross-site resource forgery (CSRF) attacks.
