You can check whether an application is registered with Auth0 as a confidential or public application. To learn more, read [Confidential and Public Application](/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications).

Auth0 determines if an application is confidential or public based on the **Authentication Method** setting, which defines how an application authenticates against the Auth0 Authentication API [Get Token](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-token) endpoint.

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to [Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications), and then select the name of the application to view.
2. If the **Credentials** view is not available, the application is a public application.
3. If the **Credentials** view is available, then select it and locate the **Authentication Method** field.

Use the applicable method:

* **None**: Public application without a <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+secret">client secret</Tooltip>.
* **Client Secret Post**: Application using POST request body parameters to send a client secret.
* **Client Secret Basic**: Application using the HTTP BASIC authentication scheme to send a client secret.
* **Private Key <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip>**: Application using asymmetric authentication.

These values map to confidential and public applications as follows:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Application Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Example</strong></th>
<th><strong>Token Endpoint Authentication Method</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Public</strong></td>
<td>Single-page or native</td>
<td><strong>None</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Confidential</strong></td>
<td>Regular web or machine-to-machine</td>
<td><strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>Post</strong>, <strong>Private Key JWT</strong>, <strong>Unspecified</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Public applications cannot maintain the confidentiality of the credentials required for <Tooltip tip="Token Endpoint: Endpoint on the Authorization Server that is used to programmatically request tokens." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Token+endpoint">Token endpoint</Tooltip> authentication methods like **Post** and **Basic**.
