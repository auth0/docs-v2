Applications can be classified as either first-party or third-party, which refers to the ownership of the application. The main difference relates to who has administrative access to your Auth0 domain.

## First-party applications

First-party applications are those controlled by the same organization or person who owns the Auth0 domain. For example, let's say you created both a Contoso API and an application that logs into `contoso.com` and consumes the Contoso API. You would register both the API and application under the same Auth0 domain, and the application would be a first-party application. By default, all applications created via the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) are first-party applications.

## Third-party applications

Third-party applications are controlled by someone who most likely should not have administrative access to your Auth0 domain. Third-party applications enable external parties or partners to securely access protected resources behind your API. An example of this is with Facebook, let's say you created an application to get a <Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+ID">client ID</Tooltip> and secret to integrate with your service. That application is considered third-party because it is not owned by Facebook but a third-party that wants to integrate with Facebook APIs and services.

All applications created through [Dynamic Client Registration](/docs/get-started/applications/dynamic-client-registration) will be third-party. Third-party applications cannot be created using the Dashboard, but must be created through the Auth0 <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> by setting `is_first_party` to `false`.

Third-party applications have the following unique characteristics:

* **User Consent**: You must require user consent when consuming APIs because anyone can create an application. Requiring the user to provide consent improves security.
* **<Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+Tokens">ID Tokens</Tooltip>**: [ID tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/id-tokens) generated for third-party applications hold only minimum user profile information.
* **Connections**: You can only use tenant-level connections or domain connections. For more information, see [Enable Third-party Applications](/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications/enable-third-party-applications).
