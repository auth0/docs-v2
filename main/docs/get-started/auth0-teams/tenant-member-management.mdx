Tenant Member Management allows Team Owners to manage tenant access and [roles](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) for Team members directly in the Teams dashboard.

## Enable Tenant Member Management

After you enable Tenant Member Management, a background process replicates all current tenant members as Team members and grants them the **Contributor** role. If a user already has a Team member account, the role with greater privileges is maintained.

## Add tenant access for a Team member

To add tenant access for a Team member through the Teams dashboard:

1. Go to **Members**.
2. Select the Team member to open their **Member details** page.
3. Select **Add Tenant Access**.
4. Type the tenant name into the search window or select a tenant from the dropdown menu. You can select up to five tenants.

   <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

   Specific Apps option is not presented if more than one tenant is selected. Select individual Tenant to assign Editor -Specific Apps role.

   </Callout>
5. Select the desired role(s) you want to assign to the Team member for all selected tenants.
6. Select **Assign**.

## Edit tenant access for a Team member

To edit tenant access for a Team member through the Teams dashboard:

1. Go to **Members**.
2. Select the Team member to open their **Member details** page, or select **Manage Tenant Access** from the ellipsis menu (**...**) next to their name.
3. Locate the desired tenant and select **Edit Roles** from the ellipsis menu (**...**).
4. Select **Assign**.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If a Team member is currently logged in and you edit their role, Auth0 forcibly logs them out and terminates their session. This may result in loss of unsaved work.

</Callout>

## Remove tenant access for a Team member

To remove tenant access for a Team member through the Teams dashboard:

1. Go to **Members**.
2. Select the Team member to open their **Member details** page.
3. Locate the desired tenant and select **Remove Access** from the ellipsis menu (**...**).
4. Select **Assign**.

If you want to remove a Team member from all tenants associated with the Team, [remove them from the Team](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/team-member-management).
