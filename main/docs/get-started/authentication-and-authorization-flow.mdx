---
Auth0 uses the [OpenID Connect (OIDC) Protocol](/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol) and [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth) to authenticate users and get their authorization to access protected resources. With Auth0, you can easily support different flows in your own applications and APIs without worrying about OIDC/<Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth+2.0">OAuth 2.0</Tooltip> specifications or other technical aspects of [authentication and authorization](/docs/get-started/identity-fundamentals/authentication-and-authorization).

We support scenarios for server-side, mobile, desktop, client-side, machine-to-machine, and device applications.

If you're not sure which flow to use, we can help you decide. To learn more, read [Which OAuth 2.0 Flow Should I Use?](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/which-oauth-2-0-flow-should-i-use).

During the execution of several flows, your application must also authenticate to the Authorization Server. To learn more about application authentication, read [Application Credentials](/docs/secure/application-credentials).

## Authorization Code Flow

Because regular web apps are server-side apps where the source code is not publicly exposed, they can use the Authorization Code Flow, which exchanges an Authorization Code for a token.

* [Authorization Code Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow)
* [Add Login Using the Authorization Code Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/add-login-auth-code-flow)
* [Call API Using the Authorization Code Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/call-your-api-using-the-authorization-code-flow)

## Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

During authentication, mobile and native applications can use the Authorization Code Flow, but they require additional security. Additionally, single-page apps have special challenges. To mitigate these, OAuth 2.0 provides a version of the Authorization Code Flow which makes use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).

* [Add Login Using the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce/add-login-using-the-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)
* [Call API Using the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce/call-your-api-using-the-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)

## Authorization Code Flow with enhanced privacy protection

During the authentication and authorization process, some use cases such as [transactional authorization](/docs/secure/highly-regulated-identity/transactional-authorization-with-authorization-code-flow) exchange contextual information, which may contain sensitive data. To protect data and sensitive information, you can use different protocol improvements for the authorization code flow:

* [Authorization Code Flow with Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-rar)
* [Authorization Code Flow with Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-par)
* [Authorization Code Flow with JWT-Secured Authorization Requests (JAR)](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-jar)
* [Authorization Code Flow with PAR and JAR](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-par-and-jar)
* [JSON Web Encryption (JWE)](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/json-web-encryption)

## Implicit Flow with Form Post

As an alternative to the Authorization Code Flow, OAuth 2.0 provides the Implicit Flow, which is intended for <Tooltip tip="Public Client: Client (application) that cannot hold credentials securely. Examples include a native desktop or mobile application and a JavaScript-based client-side web application (such as a single-page app (SPA))." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Public+Clients">Public Clients</Tooltip>, or applications which are unable to securely store <Tooltip tip="Public Client: Client (application) that cannot hold credentials securely. Examples include a native desktop or mobile application and a JavaScript-based client-side web application (such as a single-page app (SPA))." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+Secrets">Client Secrets</Tooltip>. While this is no longer considered a best practice for requesting <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Tokens">Access Tokens</Tooltip>, when used with Form Post response mode, it does offer a streamlined workflow if the application needs only an <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+token">ID token</Tooltip> to perform user authentication.

* [Implicit Flow with Form Post](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/implicit-flow-with-form-post)
* [Add Login Using the Implicit Flow with Form Post](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/implicit-flow-with-form-post/add-login-using-the-implicit-flow-with-form-post)
* [Authenticate SPAs with Cookies](/docs/manage-users/cookies/spa-authenticate-with-cookies)

## Hybrid Flow

Applications that are able to securely store Client Secrets may benefit from the use of the Hybrid Flow, which combines features of the Authorization Code Flow and Implicit Flow with Form Post to allow your application to have immediate access to an ID token while still providing for secure and safe retrieval of access and <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=refresh+tokens">refresh tokens</Tooltip>. This can be useful in situations where your application needs to immediately access information about the user, but must perform some processing before gaining access to protected resources for an extended period of time.

* [Hybrid Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/hybrid-flow)
* [Call API Using the Hybrid Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/hybrid-flow/call-api-hybrid-flow)

## Client Credentials Flow

With machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, such as CLIs, daemons, or services running on your back-end, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user. For this scenario, typical authentication schemes like identifier + password or social logins don't make sense. Instead, M2M apps use the Client Credentials Flow (defined in OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 4.4).

* [Client Credentials Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow)
* [Call API Using the Client Credentials Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow/call-your-api-using-the-client-credentials-flow)

## Device Authorization Flow

With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text. To do this, device apps use the Device <Tooltip tip="Authorization Flow: Authorization grant (or workflow) specified in the OAuth 2.0 framework." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Authorization+Flow">Authorization Flow</Tooltip> (drafted in OAuth 2.0). For use with mobile/native applications.

* [Device Authorization Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/device-authorization-flow)
* [Call API Using the Device Authorization Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/device-authorization-flow/call-your-api-using-the-device-authorization-flow)

## Resource Owner Password Flow

Though we do not recommend it, highly-trusted applications can use the <Tooltip tip="Resource Owner: Entity (such as a user or application) capable of granting access to a protected resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Resource+Owner">Resource Owner</Tooltip> Password Flow, which requests that users provide credentials (identifier and password), typically using an interactive form. The Resource Owner Password Flow should only be used when redirect-based flows (like the [Authorization Code Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow)) cannot be used.

* [Resource Owner Password Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/resource-owner-password-flow)
* [Call API Using the Resource Owner Password Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/resource-owner-password-flow/call-your-api-using-resource-owner-password-flow)

## Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication is currently in Early Access. To enable CIBA, contact your Technical Account Manager.

</Callout>

With the Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow (CIBA), rather than authenticate the user directly, the client application backend initiates an authentication flow to challenge the user for authentication. The authentication itself is performed on a separate authentication device, typically a smartphone running a custom app.

* [Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow)
* [User Authentication with CIBA](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow/user-authentication-with-ciba)
* [User Authorization with CIBA](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow/user-authorization-with-ciba)
