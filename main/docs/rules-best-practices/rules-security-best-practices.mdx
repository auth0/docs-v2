<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

</Warning>

### Always use HTTPS

Always use HTTPS, not HTTP, when making calls to external services or when executing redirect as part of your rule implementation.

### Store security sensitive values in rule Settings

Security-sensitive information, such as credentials or API keys, should be stored in your rule settings where they'll be obfuscated, encrypted, and available via the `configuration` object. Do not store these values as literals in your rules code. For example, do not write code like this:

`const myApiKey = 'abc123';`

Instead, prefer to store (secret) information so that it's accessible via the `configuration` object:

`const myApiKey = configuration.myApiKey;`

### Do not send entire context object to external services

For rules that send information to an external service, make sure you are not sending the entire context object, since this object may contain tokens or other sensitive data. For rules that send information to external services, you should only send a subset of the less sensitive attributes from the `context` object when and where necessary.

In a similar fashion, avoid passing any aspect of the `auth0` object outside of a rule.

### Check if an email is verified

You can check to see if a user's email address is verified in a rule:

```javascript lines
function (user, context, callback) {
      // Access should only be granted to verified users.
      if (!user.email || !user.email_verified) {
    return callback(new UnauthorizedError('Access denied.'));
      }
    	  .
    	  .
    }
```






However, if you want to execute different code depending on the company the user belongs to, you should not rely on the email domain, but instead, on data that can link the user to the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> that they authenticated with (the connection or identity-provider-specific fields such as Azure’s `tenant id`).

### Check for exact string matches

For rules that determine access control based on a particular string, such as an email domain, check for an exact string match instead of checking for a substring match. If you check only for a substring, your rule may not function as you intend. For example, in:

`if( _.findIndex(connection.options.domain_aliases, function(d){ return user.email.indexOf(d) >= 0;`

the code (above) would return `true` given emails such as:

* `user.domain.com@not-domain.com`
* "`user@domain.com`"`@not-domain.com` (quotes included)

which may not be as desired. Instead, prefer to perform exact matches using code such as:

`const emailSplit = user.email.split('@');
const userEmailDomain = emailSplit[emailSplit.length - 1].toLowerCase();`

To learn more, [see the **Check if user email domain matches configured domain rule template** on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0/rules/blob/master/src/rules/check-domains-against-connection-aliases.js), or navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Auth Pipeline > Rules](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules/new), and select **Create**.

### Contextual bypass for Multi-Factor Authentication

<Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Multi-Factor+Authentication">Multi-Factor Authentication</Tooltip> (MFA) provides an additional layer of security in order to guard against unauthorized access. From a user experience perspective, this typically requires additional user interaction to provide a second authentication factor—i.e., typically presenting some additional credential(s) or authorizing some form of access request.

There are situations, though, when it may be desirable to bypass MFA for a user who has been designated as requiring multi-factor authentication. For instance, it maybe desirable to bypass MFA if a user has already presented both primary and secondary factors as part of authentication in the current browser context. Contextual checking in this way can help improve the user experience. However, if not done properly, it can open up serious security loop-holes which could lead to subsequent security breaches due to MFA being skipped. We therefore recommend that you observe the following guidance when considering whether to employ contextual bypass of MFA or not.

As a recommended best practice, use of `allowRememberBrowser` or `context.authentication` should be the only options considered for contextual bypass when using out-of-box MFA. Setting `allowRememberBrowser` to `true` lets users check a box so they will only be prompted for MFA periodically, whereas `context.authentication` can be used safely and accurately to determine when MFA was last performed in the current browser context; you can see some sample use of `context.authentication` in the out-of-box supplied rule, Require MFA once per session.

* **Do not perform MFA bypass** based on conditional logic related to silent authentication (e.g., `context.request.query.prompt === 'none'`)
* **Do not perform MFA bypass** based on conditional logic using some form of device fingerprinting (e.g., where `user.app_metadata.lastLoginDeviceFingerPrint === deviceFingerPrint`)
* **Do not perform MFA bypass** based on conditional logic using geographic location (e.g., where `user.app_metadata.last_location === context.request.geoip.country_code`)

#### Context checking when using custom MFA providers

In a similar fashion to that already discussed, we recommend following guidance provided in the items listed above for any rules that redirect users to custom multi-factor authentication providers. For example, for custom providers, there's no safe way to effectively bypass MFA during silent authentication because redirection (required for custom MFA) will always fail in silent authentication situations.
