## Configure Auth0

### Get Your Application Keys

When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

<Frame>![App Dashboard](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs-v2/1.14550.0/media/articles/dashboard/client_settings.png)</Frame>

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the **Application Type** to either `SPA` or `Native`.
</Callout>

You need the following information:

* **Domain**
* **Client ID**

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.
</Callout>

### Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the **Allowed Callback URL** to `http://localhost:4200`.
</Callout>

### Configure Logout URLs

A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the authorization server. This is specified in the `returnTo` query parameter. The logout URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log out from the application and will get an error.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, the logout URL you need to add to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field is `http://localhost:4200`.
</Callout>

### Configure Allowed Web Origins

You need to add the URL for your app to the **Allowed Web Origins** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings). If you don't register your application URL here, the application will be unable to silently refresh the authentication tokens and your users will be logged out the next time they visit the application, or refresh the page.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the **Allowed Web Origins** to `http://localhost:4200`.
</Callout>

## Install the Auth0 Angular SDK

Run the following command within your project directory to install the Auth0 Angular SDK:

```bash lines
npm install @auth0/auth0-angular
```






The SDK exposes several types that help you integrate Auth0 with your Angular application idiomatically, including a module and an authentication service.

### Register and providing Auth0

The SDK exports `provideAuth0`, which is a provide function that contains all the services required for the SDK to function. To register this with your application:

1. Open the `main.ts` file.
2. Import the `provideAuth0` function from the `@auth0/auth0-angular` package.
3. Add `provideAuth0` to the application by adding it to the `providers` inside `bootstrapApplication`.
4. Inject `AuthService` into `AppComponent`.

```js lines
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { provideAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-angular';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideAuth0({
      domain: '{yourDomain}',
      clientId: '{yourClientId}',
      authorizationParams: {
        redirect_uri: window.location.origin
      }
    }),
  ]
});
```






The `provideAuth0` function takes the properties `domain` and `clientId`; the values of these properties correspond to the **Domain** and **Client ID** values that you can find under **Settings** in the Single-Page Application (SPA) that you registered with Auth0. On top of that, we configure `authorizationParams.redirect_uri`, which allows Auth0 to redirect the user back to the specific URL after successfully authenticating.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you are using a [custom domain with Auth0](/docs/customize/custom-domains), the value of the domain property is the value of your custom domain instead of the value reflected in the "Settings" tab.
</Callout>

<Note>
### Checkpoint

Now that you have imported `AuthModule`, run your application to verify that the SDK is initializing correctly and that your application is not throwing any errors related to Auth0.
</Note>

## Add Login to Your Application

The Auth0 Angular SDK gives you tools to quickly implement user authentication in your Angular application, such as creating a [login](/docs/authenticate/login) button using the `loginWithRedirect()` method from the `AuthService` service class. Executing `loginWithRedirect()` redirects your users to the Auth0 Universal Login Page, where Auth0 can authenticate them. Upon successful authentication, Auth0 will redirect your users back to your application.

```js lines
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

// Import the AuthService type from the SDK
import { AuthService } from '@auth0/auth0-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-auth-button',
  template: '<button (click)="auth.loginWithRedirect()">Log in</button>',
  standalone: true
})
export class AuthButtonComponent {
  // Inject the authentication service into your component through the constructor
  constructor(public auth: AuthService) {}
}
```





<Note>
### Checkpoint

Add the `AuthButtonComponent` component to your application. When you click it, verify that your Angular application redirects you to the [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/universal-login) page and that you can now log in or sign up using a username and password or a social provider.

Once that's complete, verify that Auth0 redirects back to your application's homepage.
</Note>

<Frame>![Auth0 Universal Login](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs-v2/1.14550.0/media/quickstarts/universal-login.png)</Frame>

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
Auth0 enables the Google social provider by default on new tenants and offers you developer keys to test logging in with [social identity providers](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers). However, these developer keys have some limitations that may cause your application to behave differently. For more details on what this behavior may look like and how to fix it, consult the [Test Social Connections with Auth0 Developer Keys](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/devkeys#limitations-of-developer-keys) document.
</Callout>

## Add Logout to Your Application

Now that you can log in to your Angular application, you need [a way to log out](/docs/authenticate/login/logout/log-users-out-of-auth0). You can create a logout button using the `logout()` method from the `AuthService` service. Executing `logout()` redirects your users to your [Auth0 logout endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication?javascript#logout) (`https://YOUR_DOMAIN/v2/logout`) and then immediately redirects them to your application.

Here is a modified version of the `AuthButtonComponent` component above that uses both `loginWithRedirect()` and `logout()`, as well as checking the authentication state using the `isAuthenticated$` observable:

```js lines
import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from '@auth0/auth0-angular';
import { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-auth-button',
  template: `
    <ng-container *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated$ | async; else loggedOut">
      <button (click)="auth.logout({ logoutParams: { returnTo: document.location.origin } })">
        Log out
      </button>
    </ng-container>

    <ng-template #loggedOut>
      <button (click)="auth.loginWithRedirect()">Log in</button>
    </ng-template>
  `,
  standalone: true
})
export class AuthButtonComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(DOCUMENT) public document: Document, public auth: AuthService) {}
}
```






Specify the `returnTo` option when calling `logout` to tell Auth0 where it should redirect to after a successful logout. This value must be specified in the [**Allowed Logout URLs**](#configure-logout-urls) setting in the dashboard.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
Here we use `http://localhost:4200` as the value for `logoutParams.returnTo`, but the associate sample uses `window.location.origin`, which in this case would resolve to the same value. Ultimately, this value should point to the root URL for your application.
</Callout>

<Note>
### Checkpoint

Add a button to the component template that logs the user out of your application. When you click it, verify that your Angular application redirects you the address you specified as one of the "Allowed Logout URLs" in the "Settings" and that you are no longer logged in to your application.
</Note>

## Show User Profile Information

The Auth0 Angular SDK helps you retrieve the [profile information](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles) associated with logged-in users quickly in whatever component you need, such as their name or profile picture, to personalize the user interface. The profile information is available through the `user$` observable exposed by the `AuthService` service. Take this `Profile` component as an example of how to use it:

```js lines
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from '@auth0/auth0-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-profile',
  template: `
    <ul *ngIf="auth.user$ | async as user">
      <li>{{ user.name }}</li>
      <li>{{ user.email }}</li>
    </ul>`,
  standalone: true
})
export class UserProfileComponent {
  constructor(public auth: AuthService) {}
}
```






The `user$` observable contains sensitive information and artifacts related to the user's identity. As such, its availability depends on the user's authentication status. Fortunately, the `user$` observable is configured so that it only starts to emit values once the `isAuthenticated$` observable is true, so there is no need to manually check the authentication state before accessing the user profile data.

<Note>
### Checkpoint

Verify that you can display the `user.name` or [any other `user` property](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/user-profile-structure#user-profile-attributes) within a component correctly after you have logged in.
