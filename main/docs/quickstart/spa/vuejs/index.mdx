## Configure Auth0

### Get Your Application Keys

When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

<Frame>![App Dashboard](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/1.14550.0/media/articles/dashboard/client_settings.png)</Frame>

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the **Application Type** to either `SPA` or `Native`.
</Callout>

You need the following information:

* **Domain**
* **Client ID**

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.
</Callout>

### Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the **Allowed Callback URL** to `http://localhost:3000`.
</Callout>

### Configure Logout URLs

A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the authorization server. This is specified in the `returnTo` query parameter. The logout URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log out from the application and will get an error.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, the logout URL you need to add to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field is `http://localhost:3000`.
</Callout>

### Configure Allowed Web Origins

You need to add the URL for your app to the **Allowed Web Origins** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings). If you don't register your application URL here, the application will be unable to silently refresh the authentication tokens and your users will be logged out the next time they visit the application, or refresh the page.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the **Allowed Web Origins** to `http://localhost:3000`.
</Callout>

## Install the SDK

Install the [Auth0 Vue SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-vue) using npm:

```sh lines
npm install @auth0/auth0-vue
```






### Register the plugin

To use the SDK in your Vue application, register the plugin with your Vue application by passing the return value of `createAuth0` to `app.use()`.

```js lines
import { createAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-vue';

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(
  createAuth0({
    domain: "{yourDomain}",
    clientId: "{yourClientId}",
    authorizationParams: {
      redirect_uri: window.location.origin
    }
  })
);

app.mount('#app');
```






The plugin will register the SDK using both `provide` and `app.config.globalProperties`, allowing the SDK to be used with both the [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html) and [Options API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#options-api).

## Add Login to Your Application

To add login to your application, use the `loginWithRedirect` function that is exposed on the return value of `useAuth0`, which you can access in your component's `setup` function.

```html lines
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="login">Log in</button>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
  import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-vue';

  export default {
    setup() {
      const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();

      return {
        login: () => {
          loginWithRedirect();
        }
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```






The `loginWithRedirect` function will redirect the user to Auth0, and redirect them back to the `redirect_uri` (provided when calling `createAuth0()`) after entering their credentials.

#### Using the Options API

If you are using the Options API, you can use the same `loginWithRedirect` method from the global `$auth0` property through the `this` accessor.

```html lines
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="login">Log in</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    methods: {
      login() {
        this.$auth0.loginWithRedirect();
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```






## Add Logout to Your Application

Use the `logout` function that is exposed on the return value of `useAuth0`, which you can access in your component's `setup` function, to log the user out of your application.

```html lines
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="logout">Log out</button>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
  import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-vue';

  export default {
    setup() {
      const { logout } = useAuth0();

      return {
        logout: () => {
          logout({ logoutParams: { returnTo: window.location.origin } });
        }
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```






The `logout()` function will redirect the user to Auth0 to ensure their session is ended with Auth0 as well. Once the user is logged out successfully, they will be redirected back to the specified `returnTo` parameter.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
To log the user out of your application but not from Auth0, use `logout({ localOnly: true })`.
</Callout>

#### Using the Options API

If you're using the Options API, you can use the same `logout` method from the global `$auth0` property through the `this` accessor.

```html lines
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="logout">Log out</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    methods: {
      logout() {
        this.$auth0.logout({ logoutParams: { returnTo: window.location.origin } });
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```






## Show User Profile Information

Once the user authenticates, the SDK extracts the user's profile information and stores it in memory. It can be accessed by using the reactive `user` property exposed by the return value of `useAuth0`, which you can access in your component's `setup` function.

```html lines
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>User Profile</h2>
    <button @click="login">Log in</button>
    <pre v-if="isAuthenticated">
        <code>{{ user }}</code>
      </pre>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
  import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-vue';

  export default {
    setup() {
      const { loginWithRedirect, user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth0();

      return {
        login: () => {
          loginWithRedirect();
        },
        user,
        isAuthenticated
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```





<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
Ensure the user is authenticated by implementing login in your application before accessing the user's profile.
</Callout>

#### Using the Options API

If you're using the Options API, you can use the same reactive `user` property from the global `$auth0` property through the `this` accessor.

```html lines
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>User Profile</h2>
    <button @click="login">Log in</button>
    <pre>
      <code>{{ user }}</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data: function () {
      return {
        user: this.$auth0.user
      };
    },
    methods: {
      login() {
        this.$auth0.loginWithRedirect();
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```
