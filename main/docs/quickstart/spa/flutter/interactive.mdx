    Auth0 allows you to quickly add authentication and access user profile information in your application. This guide
        demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with a Flutter application using the [Auth0 Flutter SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-flutter).

    <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
    The Flutter SDK currently only supports Flutter applications running on Android, iOS, or Web platforms.
    </Callout>

    This quickstart assumes you already have a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application up and running. If not, check out the [Flutter "getting
          started" guides](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to get started with a simple app.

    You should also be familiar with the [Flutter command line tool](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli).

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You
            will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the [Application
              Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

      </Frame>

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the **Token
                        Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the **Application Type** to either
                      `SPA` or `Native`.
      </Callout>

      You need the following information:

      - **Domain**
      - **Client ID**

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure Callback URLs

      A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The
            callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application
              Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should
                      set the **Allowed Callback URL** to `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure Logout URLs

      A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the
            authorization server. This is specified in the `returnTo` query parameter. The logout URL for your app
            must be added to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be
            unable to log out from the application and will get an error.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, the logout
                      URL you need to add to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field is `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure Allowed Web Origins

      You need to add the URL for your app to the **Allowed Web Origins** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings). If you don't register your application URL here, the
            application will be unable to silently refresh the authentication tokens and your users will be logged out the
            next time they visit the application, or refresh the page.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should
                      set the **Allowed Web Origins** to `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      Add the Auth0 Flutter SDK into the project:

      ```bash
      flutter pub add auth0_flutter
      ```

      

      Add the following script tag to your `index.html` page:

      ```html
      <script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0-spa-js/2.0/auth0-spa-js.production.js" defer></script>
      ```

      
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      [Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) is
            the easiest way to set up authentication in your application. We recommend using it for the best experience, best
            security, and the fullest array of features.

      Integrate Auth0 Universal Login in your Flutter Web app by using the `Auth0Web` class. Redirect your
            users to the Auth0 Universal Login page using `loginWithRedirect()`.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      You will normally need to specify the `redirectUrl` parameter to
                      `loginWithRedirect`. Omitting this will cause Auth0 to use the [default login route](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/configure-default-login-routes), which is not configured by default.
      </Callout>

      When a user logs in, they are redirected back to your application. You are then able to access the ID and access
            tokens for this user by calling `onLoad` during startup and handling the credentials that are given to
            you:

      ```js
      auth0.onLoad().then((final credentials) => setState(() {
      // Handle or store credentials here

      _credentials = credentials;

      }));
      ```

      

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your app that calls `loginWithRedirect()` and logs the user into your app.
                    Verify that you are redirected to Auth0 for authentication and then back to your application.

      Verify that you can access `credentials` as a result of calling `onLoad` and that
                    you're able to access the ID and access tokens.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      To log users out, redirect them to the Auth0 logout endpoint to clear their login session by calling the Auth0
            Flutter SDK `logout()`. [Read
              more about logging out of Auth0](/docs/authenticate/login/logout).

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      You will normally want to specify `returnToUrl` when calling `logout`, otherwise
                      Auth0 [will default to the first URL in the Allowed Logout URLs list](/docs/authenticate/login/logout/redirect-users-after-logout).
      </Callout>

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your app that calls `logout()` and logs the user out of your application. When
                    you select it, verify that your Flutter app redirects you to the logout endpoint and back again. You
                    should not be logged in to your application.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      The user profile automatically retrieves user profile properties for you when the page loads, and can be accessed
            and stored by calling `onLoad` during application startup. The returned object from `onLoad`
            contains a `user` property with all the user profile properties. This is internally populated by
            decoding the ID token.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Log in and inspect the `user` property on the result. Verify the current user's profile
                    information, such as `email` or `name`.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

  ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.<br/><br/>
