# Add login to your Flutter app

Auth0 allows you to quickly add authentication and access user profile information in your application. This guide demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with a Flutter Web application using the [Auth0 Flutter SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-flutter).

<Info>
The Flutter SDK currently only supports Flutter applications running on Android, iOS, or Web platforms.
</Info>

## Getting started

This quickstart assumes you already have a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application up and running. If not, check out the [Flutter "getting started" guides](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to get started with a simple app.

You should also be familiar with the [Flutter command line tool](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli).

<Info>
**New to Auth?** Learn [How Auth0 works](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview), how it [integrates with Single-Page Applications](/docs/get-started/architecture-scenarios/spa-api) and which [protocol](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) it uses.
</Info>

## Configure Auth0

### Get Your Application Keys

When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

<Frame>![App Dashboard](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/1.14550.0/media/articles/dashboard/client_settings.png)</Frame>
<Info>
When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the **Application Type** to either `SPA` or `Native`.
</Info>

You need the following information:

* **Domain**
* **Client ID**

<Info>
If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.
</Info>

### Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.

<Info>
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the **Allowed Callback URL** to `http://localhost:3000`.
</Info>

### Configure Logout URLs

A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the authorization server. This is specified in the `returnTo` query parameter. The logout URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log out from the application and will get an error.
<Info>
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, the logout URL you need to add to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field is `http://localhost:3000`.
</Info>

### Configure Allowed Web Origins

You need to add the URL for your app to the **Allowed Web Origins** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings). If you don't register your application URL here, the application will be unable to silently refresh the authentication tokens and your users will be logged out the next time they visit the application, or refresh the page.
<Info>
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the **Allowed Web Origins** to `http://localhost:3000`.
</Info>

## Install the Auth0 Flutter SDK

Add the Auth0 Flutter SDK into the project:

```bash lines
flutter pub add auth0_flutter
```






Add the following script tag to your `index.html` page:

```html lines
<script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0-spa-js/2.0/auth0-spa-js.production.js" defer></script>
```






## Add login to your app

[Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) is the easiest way to set up authentication in your application. We recommend using it for the best experience, best security, and the fullest array of features.

Integrate Auth0 Universal Login in your Flutter app by importing the SDK and instantiating the `Auth0` class using your Auth0 domain and Client ID values. See this example, which instantiates the class inside a widget state object:

```dart lines
import 'package:auth0_flutter/auth0_flutter.dart';
import 'package:auth0_flutter/auth0_flutter_web.dart';

class MainView extends StatefulWidget {
  const MainView({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<MainView> createState() => _MainViewState();
}

class _MainViewState extends State<MainView> {
  Credentials? _credentials;

  late Auth0Web auth0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    auth0 = Auth0Web('{yourDomain}', '{yourClientId}');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // ...
  }
}
```






Next, redirect your users to the Auth0 Universal Login page using `loginWithRedirect`. See this example of a `ElevatedButton` widget that logs the user in when clicked:

<Info>
You will normally need to specify the `redirectUrl` parameter to `loginWithRedirect`. Omitting this will cause Auth0 to use the [default login route](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/configure-default-login-routes), which is not configured by default.
</Info>

```dart lines
if (_credentials == null) {
  ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () => auth0.loginWithRedirect(redirectUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'),
    child: const Text("Log in")
  )
}
```






When a user logs in, they are redirected back to your application. You are then able to access the ID and access tokens for this user by calling `onLoad` during startup and handling the credentials that are given to you:

```dart lines
auth0.onLoad().then((final credentials) => setState(() {
    // Handle or store credentials here
    _credentials = credentials;
  }));
```





<Note>
##### Checkpoint

Add a button to your app that calls `loginWithRedirect()` and logs the user into your app. Verify that you are redirected to Auth0 for authentication and then back to your application.

Verify that you can access `credentials` as a result of calling `onLoad` and that you're able to access the ID and access tokens.
</Note>

## Add logout to your app

To log users out, redirect them to the Auth0 logout endpoint to clear their login session by calling the Auth0 Flutter SDK `logout()`. [Read more about logging out of Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout).

See this example of an `ElevatedButton` widget that logs the user out of the app:

```dart lines
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await auth0.logout();
  },
  child: const Text("Log out"))
```






<Note>
##### Checkpoint

Add a button to your app that calls `logout()` and logs the user out of your application. When you select it, verify that your Flutter app redirects you to the logout endpoint and back again. You should not be logged in to your application.
</Note>

## Show user profile information

The user profile automatically retrieves user profile properties for you when the page loads, and can be accessed and stored by calling `onLoad` during application startup. The returned object from `onLoad` contains a `user` property with all the user profile properties. This is internally populated by decoding the ID token.

See this example of a `View` component that displays the user profile on the screen:

```dart lines
import 'package:auth0_flutter/auth0_flutter.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class ProfileView extends StatelessWidget {
  const ProfileView({Key? key, required this.user}) : super(key: key);

  final UserProfile user;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        if (user.name != null) Text(user.name!),
        if (user.email != null) Text(user.email!)
      ],
    );
  }
}
```






<Note>
##### Checkpoint

Log in and inspect the `user` property on the result. Verify the current user's profile information, such as `email` or `name`.
