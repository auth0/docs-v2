    Auth0 allows you to add authorization to any kind of application. This guide demonstrates how to integrate Auth0
        with any new or existing ASP.NET Owin Web API application using the `Microsoft.Owin.Security.Jwt`
        package.

    If you have not created an API in your Auth0 dashboard yet, you can use the interactive selector to create a new
        Auth0 API or select an existing API for your project.

    To set up your first API through the Auth0 dashboard, review our getting started guide.

    Each Auth0 API uses the API Identifier, which your application needs to validate the access token.

    <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
    **New to Auth0?** Learn how Auth0 works and
                  read about implementing API authentication and
                    authorization using the OAuth 2.0 framework.
    </Callout>

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      Permissions let you define how resources can be accessed on behalf of the user with a given access token. For
            example, you might choose to grant read access to the `messages` resource if users have the manager
            access level, and a write access to that resource if they have the administrator access level.

      
      You can define allowed permissions in the **Permissions** view of the Auth0 Dashboard's [APIs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis) section. The following
            example uses the `read:messages` scope.

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      Install the `Microsoft.Owin.Security.Jwt` NuGetPackage. This package contains the OWIN JWT Middleware
            necessary to use Auth0 access tokens in the ASP.NET Owin Web API.

      ```ps lines
      Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.Jwt
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      Go to the `Configuration` method of your `Startup` class and add a call to
            `UseJwtBearerAuthentication` passing in the configured `JwtBearerAuthenticationOptions`.

      The `JwtBearerAuthenticationOptions` needs to specify your Auth0 API Identifier in the
            `ValidAudience` property, and the full path to your Auth0 domain as the `ValidIssuer`. You
            will need to configure the `IssuerSigningKeyResolver` to use the instance of
            `OpenIdConnectSigningKeyResolver` to resolve the signing key.

      <Warning>
      **Do not forget the trailing slash.**

      Ensure the URL specified for `ValidIssuer` contains a trailing forward slash
                      (`/`). This must match exactly with the JWT issuer claim. API calls will not authenticate
                      correctly if you misconfigured this value.

      </Warning>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      The OWIN JWT middleware does not use Open ID Connect Discovery by default, so you must provide a custom
            `IssuerSigningKeyResolver`.

      Create the `OpenIdConnectSigningKeyResolver` class and ensure to return the correct
            `SecurityKey` by implementing `GetSigningKey`. This class is then used as
            `TokenValidationParameters.IssuerSigningKeyResolver` while configuring the middleware in
            `Startup.cs`.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      This custom resolver is deprecated and [no longer available](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-aspnet-owin/blob/master/SECURITY-NOTICE.md). You must provide this custom resolver yourself.

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      The JWT middleware verifies that the access token included in the request is valid; however, it doesn't yet
            include any mechanism for checking that the token has the sufficient **scope** to access the requested
            resources.

      Create a class called `ScopeAuthorizeAttribute` which inherits from
            `System.Web.Http.AuthorizeAttribute`. This attribute will check that the `scope` claim
            issued by your Auth0 tenant is present, and if so, it will ensure that the `scope` claim contains the
            requested scope.
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      The routes shown below are available for the following requests:

      - `GET /api/public`: Available for non-authenticated requests.
      - `GET /api/private`: Available for authenticated requests containing an access token with no
                additional scopes.
      - `GET /api/private-scoped`: Available for authenticated requests containing an access token with
                the `read:messages`scope granted.

      The JWT middleware integrates with the standard ASP.NET authentication and authorization mechanisms, so you only
            need to decorate your controller action with the `[Authorize]` attribute to secure an endpoint.

      Update the action with the `ScopeAuthorize` attribute and pass the name of the required
            `scope` in the `scope` parameter. This ensures the correct scope is available to call a
            specific API endpoint.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Now that you have configured your application, run your application and verify that:

      - `GET /api/public`is available for non-authenticated requests.
      - `GET /api/private`is available for authenticated requests.
      - `GET /api/private-scoped`is available for authenticated requests containing an access
                        token with the `read:messages`scope.

    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
