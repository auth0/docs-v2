      To use Auth0 services, youâ€™ll need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
            where you will configure how you want authentication to work for the project you are developing.

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that represents
            the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID
            that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your Application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
            can manage your Applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample application instead.

      ### Configure Callback URLs

      A callback URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have
            authenticated. If not set, users will not be returned to your application after they log in.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `http://localhost:3000/auth/auth0/callback`.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure Logout URLs

      A logout URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have logged
            out. If not set, users will not be able to log out from your application and will receive an error.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure Allowed Web Origins

      An Allowed Web Origin is a URL that you want to be allowed to access to your authentication flow. This must
            contain the URL of your project. If not properly set, your project will be unable to silently refresh
            authentication tokens, so your users will be logged out the next time they visit your application or refresh a
            page.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      Use `omniauth-auth0`, a custom [OmniAuth strategy](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth#omniauth-standardized-multi-provider-authentication), to handle the authentication flow.

      Add the following dependencies to your `Gemfile`:

      ```gem lines
      gem 'omniauth-auth0', '~> 3.0'
      gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection', '~> 1.0' # prevents forged authentication requests
      ```


      Once your gems are added, install the gems with `bundle install`.
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      Create a configuration file `./config/auth0.yml` to specify your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client
            secret values located in your Auth0 Dashboard under application **Settings**.
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      Create the following initializer file `./config/initializers/auth0.rb` and [configure](https://github.com/auth0/omniauth-auth0/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md#send-additional-authentication-parameters) the **OmniAuth** middleware with the configuration
            file you created in the previous step.

      Ensure that `callback_path` matches the value given in the "Allowed Callback URLs" setting in your
            Auth0 application.
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      Create an Auth0 controller to handle the authentication callback, `logout` action, and methods for
            constructing the logout URL.

      Run the command:
            `rails generate controller auth0 callback failure logout --skip-assets --skip-helper --skip-routes --skip-template-engine`.

      Inside the callback method, assign the hash of user information - returned as
            `request.env['omniauth.auth']` - to the active session.

      To configure logout, clear all the objects stored within the session by calling the `reset_session`
            method within the `logout` action. Then, redirect to the Auth0 logout endpoint. To learn more about
            `reset_session`, read [Ruby on Rails ActionController documentation](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Base.html#M000668).
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      Add these routes to your `./config/routes.rb` file.

      Routes must be in place so Rails knows how to route the various Auth0 callback URLs to the Auth0 controller you
            created in the previous step.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Run your application to verify it continues to work as intended and you aren't receive any errors
                    relating to Auth0.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[6].id} title={sections[6].title} stepNumber="7">
      A user can now log into your application by visiting the `/auth/auth0` endpoint.

      <Warning>
      To [prevent forged authentication requests](https://github.com/cookpad/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection), use the `link_to` or
                      `button_to` helper methods with the `:post` method.
      </Warning>

      ```ruby lines
      <!-- Place a login button anywhere on your application -->
      <%= button_to 'Login', '/auth/auth0', method: :post %>
      ```


      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your application that redirects the user to the `/auth/auth0` endpoint when
                    selected. Observe that you redirect to Auth0 to log in, and then back to your app after successful
                    authentication.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[7].id} title={sections[7].title} stepNumber="8">
      Now that you can log in to your Rails application, you need a
              way to log out. Log out a user by redirecting to the `auth/logout` action, which redirects them
            to the Auth0 logout endpoint.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      To test this after the previous step, you may need to clear out your session and then redirect the user
                      to the Auth0 logout endpoint.
      </Callout>

      ```ruby lines
      <!-- Place a logout button anywhere on your application -->
      <%= button_to 'Logout', 'auth/logout', method: :get %>
      ```


      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your application that redirects the user to the `/auth/logout` endpoint when
                    selected. Verify that you redirect to Auth0 and then quickly back to your application, and that you are no
                    longer logged in.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[8].id} title={sections[8].title} stepNumber="9">
      To display the user's profile, your application should provide a protected route. You can use a [Concern](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#using-concerns) to control access to routes that can be shared across multiple
            controllers. The concern should automatically redirect to Auth0 when the user is unauthenticated. Otherwise, the
            concern should return the current user profile.

      Once you have a Concern, include it in any controller that requires a logged-in user. You can then access the
            user from the session `session[:userinfo]` as in the following example:

      ```ruby lines
      class DashboardController < ApplicationController
      include Secured
      def show
      @user = session[:userinfo]

      end
      end
      ```


      Once the user loads from the session, use it to display information in your frontend:

      ```html lines
      <div>
      <p>Normalized User Profile:<%= JSON.pretty_generate(@user[:info])%></p>
      <p>Full User Profile:<%= JSON.pretty_generate(@user[:extra][:raw_info])%></p>
      </div>
      ```


      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add the `Secured` concern to your app and then include it in the controller that requires an
                    authenticated user to access it. Verify that an authenticated user has access to actions within that
                    controller and that unauthenticated users are redirected to Auth0 for authentication.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
