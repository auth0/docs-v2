</Card> */}
## Getting started

This quickstart assumes you already have an [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) application up and running with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/). If not, check out the [Using Capacitor with Ionic Framework guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) to get started with a simple app, or clone [our sample apps](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ionic-samples).

You should also be familiar with the [Capacitor development workflow](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/basics/workflow).

**New to Auth?** Learn [How Auth0 works](/docs/overview), how it [integrates with Native Applications](/docs/architecture-scenarios/application/mobile-api) and which [protocol](/docs/api-auth/grant/authorization-code-pkce) it uses.
</Callout>

## Configure Auth0

### Get Your Application Keys

When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

<Frame>![App Dashboard](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/1.14550.0/media/articles/dashboard/client_settings.png)</Frame>

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the **Application Type** to either `SPA` or `Native`.
</Callout>

You need the following information:

* **Domain**
* **Client ID**

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.
</Callout>


### Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
Throughout this article, `YOUR_PACKAGE_ID` is your application's package ID. This can be found and configured in the `appId` field in your `capacitor.config.ts` file. See [Capacitors Config schema](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/config#schema) for more info.
</Callout>

Go to the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings) section in your Auth0 dashboard and set your **Callback URL** in the **Allowed Callback URLs** box.

You should set the **Allowed Callback URL** to:

```
YOUR_PACKAGE_ID://{yourDomain}/capacitor/YOUR_PACKAGE_ID/callback
```






### Configure Logout URLs

A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the authorization server. This is specified in the `returnTo` query parameter. The logout URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log out from the application and will get an error.

You should set the **Allowed Logout URLs** to

```
YOUR_PACKAGE_ID://{yourDomain}/capacitor/YOUR_PACKAGE_ID/callback
```






### Configure Origins

To be able to make requests from your application to Auth0, set the following **Allowed Origins** in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings).

```
capacitor://localhost, http://localhost
```






These origins are required for iOS and Android respectively.

Lastly, be sure that the **Application Type** for your application is set to **Native** in the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings).

## Install the Auth0 Vue SDK

Run the following command within your project directory to install the Auth0 Vue SDK:

```
npm install @auth0/auth0-vue
```






The SDK exposes several types that help you integrate Auth0 with your Vue application idiomatically, including a module and an authentication service.

### Install Capacitor plugins

This quickstart and sample make use of some of Capacitor's official plugins. Install these into your app using the following command:

```
npm install @capacitor/browser @capacitor/app
```






* [`@capacitor/browser`](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/browser) - allows you to interact with the device's system browser and is used to open the URL to Auth0's authorizaction endpoint
* [`@capacitor/app`](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/app) - allows you to subscribe to high-level app events, useful for handling callbacks from Auth0

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
Capacitor's Browser plugin on iOS uses [`SFSafariViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller), which on iOS 11+ does not share cookies with Safari on the device. This means that [SSO](https://auth0.com/docs/sso) will not work on those devices. If you need SSO, please instead use a compatible plugin that uses [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession).
</Callout>

### Configure the createAuth0 plugin

The SDK exports `createAuth0`, a composable that contains all the services required for the SDK to function. To register this with your application:

Open `src/main.ts` and install the plugin using `app.use`

```js lines
import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
import router from "./router";

import { IonicVue } from "@ionic/vue";

import { createAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-vue";
import config from "./auth.config";

// ..

// Build the URL that Auth0 should redirect back to
const redirect_uri = `${config.appId}://{yourDomain}/capacitor/${config.appId}/callback`;

const app = createApp(App).use(IonicVue).use(router);

app.use(
  createAuth0({
    domain: "{yourDomain}",
    clientId: "{yourClientId}",
    useRefreshTokens: true,
    useRefreshTokensFallback: false,
    authorizationParams: {
      redirect_uri
    }
  })
);

router.isReady().then(() => {
  app.mount("#app");
});
```






The `createAuth0` plugin takes the following props:

* `domain`: The "domain" value present under the "Settings" of the application you created in your Auth0 dashboard, or your custom domain if using Auth0's [Custom Domains feature](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains)
* `clientId`: The "client ID" value present under the "Settings" of the application you created in your Auth0 dashboard
* `useRefreshTokens`: To use auth0-vue with Ionic on Android and iOS, it's required to enable refresh tokens.
* `useRefreshTokensFallback`: To use auth0-vue with Ionic on Android and iOS, it's required to disable the iframe fallback.
* `authorizationParams.redirect_uri`: The URL to where you'd like to redirect your users after they authenticate with Auth0.

<Warning>
To persist authentication after closing and reopening the application, you may want to set `cacheLocation` to `localstorage` when configuring the SDK, but please be aware of [the risks of storing tokens in localstorage](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-single-page-app-sdk#change-storage-options). Also, localstorage should be treated as **transient** in Capacitor app as the data might be recovered unexpectedly in certain circumstances. Please read the [guidance on storage in the Capacitor docs](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/storage#why-cant-i-just-use-localstorage-or-indexeddb).

Additionally, the SDK has the ability to [use a custom cache implementation](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md#creating-a-custom-cache) to store tokens, if you have a requirement to use a more secure and persistent storage mechanism.

**Note** that we recommend **against** using [Capacitors Storage plugin](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/storage) to store tokens, as this is backed by [UserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) and [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences) on iOS and Android respectively. Data stored using these APIs is not encrypted, not secure, and could also be synced to the cloud.
</Warning>

<Note>
### Checkpoint

Now that you have configured `createAuth0` plugin, run your application to verify that the SDK is initializing correctly, and your application is not throwing any errors related to Auth0.
</Note>

## Add Login to Your Application

In a Capacitor application, the [Capacitors Browser plugin](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/browser) performs a redirect to the Auth0 [Universal Login Page](https://auth0.com/universal-login). Set the `openUrl` parameter on the `loginWithRedirect` function to use `Browser.open` so that the URL is opened using the device's system browser component ([SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) on iOS, and [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs) on Android).

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
By default, the SDK's `loginWithRedirect` method uses `window.location.href` to navigate to the login page in the default browser application on the user's device rather than the system browser component appropriate for the platform. The user would leave your application to authenticate and could make for a suboptimal user experience.
</Callout>

Add a new file `LoginButton.vue` with the following code:

```html lines
<template>
  <ion-button @click="login">Log in</ion-button>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import { IonApp, IonRouterOutlet } from "@ionic/vue";

import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-vue";
import { App as CapApp } from "@capacitor/app";
import { Browser } from "@capacitor/browser";

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    IonButton,
  },
  setup() {
    const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();

    const login = async () => {
      await loginWithRedirect({
        openUrl: (url: string) =>
          Browser.open({
            url,
            windowName: "_self",
          }),
      });
    };

    return { login };
  },
});
</script>
```






This component:

* defines a template with a simple button that logs the user in when clicked
* uses `loginWithRedirect` to login using Auth0's Universal Login page
* uses the `openUrl` callback to use Capacitor's Browser plugin to open the URL and show the login page to the user

### Handling the callback

Once users logs in with the Universal Login Page, they redirect back to your app via a URL with a custom URL scheme. The `appUrlOpen` event must be handled within your app. You can call the `handleRedirectCallback` method from the Auth0 SDK to initialize the authentication state.

You can only use this method on a redirect from Auth0. To verify success, check for the presence of the `code` and `state` parameters in the URL.

The `Browser.close()` method should close the browser when this event is raised.

Add the following capacitor application listener to your main `App` component:

```html lines
<template>
  <ion-app>
    <ion-router-outlet />
  </ion-app>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-vue";
import { IonApp, IonRouterOutlet } from "@ionic/vue";
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import { App as CapApp } from "@capacitor/app";
import { Browser } from "@capacitor/browser";

export default defineComponent({
  name: "App",
  components: {
    IonApp,
    IonRouterOutlet,
  },
  setup() {
    const { handleRedirectCallback } = useAuth0();

    // Handle the 'appUrlOpen' event and call `handleRedirectCallback`
    CapApp.addListener('appUrlOpen', async ({ url }) => {
      if (url.includes('state') && (url.includes('code') || url.includes('error'))) {
        await handleRedirectCallback(url);
      }
      // No-op on Android
      await Browser.close();
    });
  },
});
</script>
```





<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
This article assumes you will be using Custom URL Schemes to handle the callback within your application. To do this, register your `YOUR_PACKAGE_ID` as a URL scheme for your chosen platform. To learn more, read [Defining a Custom URL Scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) for iOS, or [Create Deep Links to App Content](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) for Android.
</Callout>

<Note>
### Checkpoint

Add the `LoginButton` component to your application, as well as the handler for the "appUrlOpen" event to your `App` component. When you click the login button, verify that your application redirects you to the Auth0 Universal Login Page and that you can now log in or sign up using a username and password or a social provider.

Once that's complete, verify that Auth0 redirects you back to your application.
</Note>

## Add Logout to Your Application

Now that users can log in, you need to configure [a way to log out](https://auth0.com/docs/logout/guides/logout-auth0). Users must redirect to the Auth0 logout endpoint in the browser to clear their browser session. Again, Capacitor's Browser plugin should perform this redirect so that the user does not leave your app and receive a suboptimal experience.

To achieve this with Ionic and Capacitor in conjunction with the Auth0 SDK:

* Construct the URL for your app Auth0 should use to redirect to after logout. This is a URL that uses your registered custom scheme and Auth0 domain. Add it to your **Allowed Logout URLs** configuration in the Auth0 Dashboard
* Logout from the SDK by calling `logout`, and pass your redirect URL back as the `logoutParams.returnTo` parameter.
* Set the `openUrl` parameter to a callback that uses the Capacitor browser plugin to open the URL using `Browser.open`.

<Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
Similar to the login step, if you do not set `openUrl` when calling `logout`, the SDK redirects the user to the logout URL using the default browser application on the device, which provides a suboptimal user experience.
</Callout>

Create a new file `LogoutButton.vue` and add the following code to the file. Then, add the `LogoutButton` component to your app.

```html lines
<template>
  <ion-button @click="onLogout">Log out</ion-button>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-vue";
import { Browser } from "@capacitor/browser";
import { IonButton } from "@ionic/vue";
import { callbackUri } from "../auth.config";

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    IonButton,
  },
  setup() {
    const { logout } = useAuth0();

    const onLogout = async () => {
      await logout({
        logoutParams: {
          returnTo: callbackUri,
        },
        openUrl: (url: string) =>
          Browser.open({
            url,
            windowName: "_self",
          }),
      });
    };

    return {
      onLogout,
    };
  },
});
</script>
```





<Note>
### Checkpoint

Add the `LogoutButton` component to your application. When you click it, verify that your Ionic application redirects you the address you specified as one of the "Allowed Logout URLs" in the "Settings" and that you are no longer logged in to your application.
</Note>

## Show User Profile Information

The Auth0 Vue SDK helps you retrieve the [profile information](https://auth0.com/docs/users/concepts/overview-user-profile) associated with logged-in users quickly in whatever component you need, such as their name or profile picture, to personalize the user interface. The profile information is available through the `user` property exposed by the `useAuth0()` composable. Take this `UserProfile` component as an example of how to use it:

```html lines
<template>
  <div v-if="isLoading">Loading ...</div>
  <div v-else-if="!user"></div>
  <div v-else class="profile-container">
    <ion-avatar>
      <Frame><img :src="user.picture" :alt="user.name" /></Frame>
    </ion-avatar>
    <h2>{{ user.name }}</h2>
    <p>{{ user.email }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-vue";
import { IonAvatar } from "@ionic/vue";

export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    IonAvatar,
  },
  setup() {
    const { user, isLoading } = useAuth0();

    return { user, isLoading };
  },
});
</script>
```






The `user` property contains sensitive information and artifacts related to the user's identity. As such, its availability depends on the user's authentication status. To prevent any render errors, use the `isAuthenticated` property from `useAuth0()` to check if Auth0 has authenticated the user before Vue renders any component that consumes the `user` property. Ensure that the SDK has completed loading before accessing the `isAuthenticated` property, by checking that `isLoading` is `false`.

<Note>
### Checkpoint

Add the `UserProfile` component to your application, and verify that you can display the `user.name` or [any other `user` property](https://auth0.com/docs/users/references/user-profile-structure#user-profile-attributes) within a component correctly after you have logged in.
