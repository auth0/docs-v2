    Auth0 allows you to quickly add authentication and access user profile information in your app. This guide
        demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with a Flutter app using the [Auth0 Flutter SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-flutter).

    <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
    The Flutter SDK currently only supports Flutter apps for Android, iOS, and macOS.
    </Callout>

    This quickstart assumes you already have a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) app up and running. If not, check out the [Flutter "getting
          started" guides](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to get started with a simple app.

    You should also be familiar with the [Flutter command line tool](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli).

    <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
    **New to Auth?** Learn [How Auth0 works](https://auth0.com/docs/overview),
                  how it [integrates with Single-Page Applications](https://auth0.com/docs/architecture-scenarios/application/spa-api) and which [protocol](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce) it uses.
    </Callout>

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      To use Auth0 services, you need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
            where you will configure how you want authentication to work for your project.

      ### Configure an Auth0 application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing **Native** Auth0
            application. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID that your application code
            will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/auth0-dsepaid/), which is where you can manage your applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample app instead.

      ### Configure the callback and logout URLs

      The callback and logout URLs are the URLs that Auth0 invokes to redirect back to your app. Auth0 invokes the
            callback URL after authenticating the user, and the logout URL after removing the session cookie. If the callback
            and logout URLs are not set, users will be unable to log in and out of the app and will get an error.

      Set the callback and logout URLs to the following values, depending on your platform.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      On Android, the value of the `SCHEME` placeholder can be `https` or some other
                      custom scheme. `https` schemes require enabling [Android App Links](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/enable-android-app-links-support).

      On iOS 17.4+ and macOS 14.4+ it is possible to use Universal Links (`https` scheme) as
                      callback and logout URLs. When enabled, the SDK will fall back to using a custom URL scheme on older iOS
                      / macOS versions â€“your app's [bundle identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids). **This feature requires Xcode 15.3+ and a paid Apple
                        Developer account**.
      </Callout>

      #### Android

      ```
      SCHEME://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/android/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/callback
      ```

      #### iOS

      ```
      https://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback,
      ```

      ```
      YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
      ```

      #### macOS

      ```
      https://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback,
      ```

      ```
      YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
      ```

      For example, if your iOS bundle identifier were `com.example.MyApp` and your Auth0 domain were
            `example.us.auth0.com`, then this value would be:

      ```
      https://example.us.auth0.com/ios/com.example.MyApp/callback,
      ```

      ```
      com.example.MyApp://example.us.auth0.com/ios/com.example.MyApp/callback
      ```
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      Add the Auth0 Flutter SDK into the project:

      ```
      flutter pub add auth0_flutter
      ```
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      If you are not developing for the Android platform, skip this step.

      The SDK requires manifest placeholders. Auth0 uses placeholders internally to define an
            `intent-filter`, which captures the authentication callback URL. You must set the Auth0 tenant domain
            and the callback URL scheme.

      The [sample](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-flutter-samples/tree/main/sample/android) uses the following placeholders:

      - `auth0Domain`: The domain of your Auth0 tenant. Generally, you find this in the Auth0 Dashboard
                under your **Application Settings** in the **Domain** field. If you are using a custom domain, you
                should set this to the value of your custom domain instead.
      - `auth0Scheme`: The scheme to use. Can be a custom scheme, or https if you want to use [Android App Links](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/enable-android-app-links).
                You can read more about setting this value in the [Auth0.Android SDK README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android#a-note-about-app-deep-linking).

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      You do not need to declare a specific `intent-filter` for your activity because you defined
                      the manifest placeholders with your Auth0 **Domain** and **Scheme** values. The library handles
                      the redirection for you.
      </Callout>

      Run **Sync Project with Gradle Files** inside Android Studio to apply your changes.

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      If you are not developing for the iOS or macOS platforms, skip this step.

      <Warning>
      This step requires a paid Apple Developer account. It is needed to use Universal Links as callback and
                      logout URLs. Skip this step to use a custom URL scheme instead.
      </Warning>

      ### Configure the Team ID and bundle identifier

      Go to the [settings page](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings) of your Auth0 application, scroll to the end, and open **Advanced
              Settings > Device Settings**. In the **iOS** section, set **Team ID** to your [Apple Team ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id/), and **App ID** to your app's bundle identifier.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/7wetuICumueyqt6dbB32ro/df8658dff11b699ac94c578ff3dd2d8a/IOS_Settings_-_English.png" />
      </Frame>

      This will add your app to your Auth0 tenant's `apple-app-site-association` file.

      ### Add the associated domain capability

      Open your app in Xcode by running `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace` (or
            `open macos/Runner.xcworkspace` for macOS). Go to the **Signing and Capabilities** [tab](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability) of the **Runner** target settings, and press the **+
              Capability** button. Then select **Associated Domains**.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/3GO76kXynaieKs5CSj3UTp/1cc577b56d00bc3bad877e31b848c1ec/ios-xcode-capabilities.png" />
      </Frame>

      Next, add the following [entry](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-an-associated-domain#Define-a-service-and-its-associated-domain) under **Associated Domains**:

      ```
      webcredentials:dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com
      ```

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      For the associated domain to work, your app must be signed with your team certificate **even when
                        building for the iOS simulator**. Make sure you are using the Apple Team whose Team ID is configured
                      in the settings page of your Auth0 application.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      Universal Login is the easiest way to set up
            authentication in your app. We recommend using it for the best experience, best security, and the fullest array of
            features.

      Integrate Auth0 Universal Login in your Flutter app by using the `Auth0` class. Redirect your users to
            the Auth0 Universal Login page using `webAuthentication().login()`. This is a `Future` and
            must be awaited for you to retrieve the user's tokens.

      **Android**: if you are using a custom scheme, pass this scheme to the login method so that the SDK can route
            to the login page and back again correctly:

      ```
      await auth0.webAuthentication(scheme: 'YOUR CUSTOM SCHEME').login();
      ```

      When a user logs in, they are redirected back to your app. Then, you are able to access the ID and access tokens
            for this user.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your app that calls `webAuthentication().login()` and logs the user into your
                    app. Verify that you are redirected to Auth0 for authentication and then back to your app.

      Verify that you can get access to the tokens on the result of calling `login`.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      To log users out, redirect them to the Auth0 logout endpoint to clear their login session by calling the Auth0
            Flutter SDK `webAuthentication().logout()`. Read
              more about logging out of Auth0.

      **Android**: if you are using a custom scheme, pass this scheme to the logout method so that the SDK can route
            back to your app correctly:

      ```
      await auth0.webAuthentication(scheme: 'YOUR CUSTOM SCHEME').logout();
      ```

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your app that calls `webAuthentication().logout()` and logs the user out of
                    your app. When you select it, verify that your Flutter app redirects you to the logout endpoint and back
                    again. You should not be logged in to your app.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[6].id} title={sections[6].title} stepNumber="7">
      The user profile automatically retrieves user profile properties for you when you call
            `webAuthentication().login()`. The returned object from the login step contains a `user`
            property with all the user profile properties, which populates by decoding the ID token.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Log in and inspect the `user` property on the result. Verify the current user's profile
                    information, such as `email` or `name`.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
