      To use Auth0 services, you need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
              where you will configure authentication in your project.

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that
              represents the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric,
              unique client ID that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your Application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
              can manage your Applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample application instead.

      ### Configure callback URLs

      A callback URL is the application URL that Auth0 will direct your users to once they have authenticated. If you
              do not set this value, Auth0 will not return users to your application after they log in.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                        `demo://{yourDomain}/android/YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME/callback`.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure logout URLs

      A logout URL is the application URL Auth0 will redirect your users to once they log out. If you do not set this
              value, users will not be able to log out from your application and will receive an error.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                        `demo://{yourDomain}/android/YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME/callback`
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      Add the [Auth0
                Android](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android) SDK into your project. The library will make requests to the Auth0's Authentication and Management
              APIs.

      In your app's `build.gradle` dependencies section, add the following:

      ```gradle lines
      implementation 'com.auth0.android:auth0:2. '
      ```


      Ensure you target Java 8+ byte code for Android and Kotlin plugins respectively.
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      The SDK requires manifest placeholders. Auth0 uses placeholders internally to define an
              `intent-filter`, which captures the authentication callback URL. You must set Auth0 tenant domain and
              the callback URL scheme.

      You do not need to declare a specific `intent-filter` for your activity, because you have defined
              the manifest placeholders with your Auth0 **Domain** and **Scheme** values and the library will handle the
              redirection for you.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      We've used a value of `demo` for `auth0Scheme` here, so that a custom URL
                        scheme can be used for the URL that Auth0 redirects to after login. The alternative is
                        `https` if you want to use [Android App
                          Links](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/enable-android-app-links). You can read more about setting this value in the [Auth0.Android SDK README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android#a-note-about-app-deep-linking).
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      For the SDK to function properly, you must set the following properties in `strings.xml`:

      - `com_auth0_domain`: The domain of your Auth0 tenant. Generally, you can find this in the Auth0
                  Dashboard under your Application's Settings in the Domain field. If you are using a [custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), you should set this to the
                  value of your custom domain instead.
      - `com_auth0_client_id`: The ID of the Auth0 Application you set up earlier in this quickstart.
                  You can find this in the Auth0 Dashboard under your Application's Settings in the Client ID field.

      Ensure that the `AndroidManifest.xml` file specifies the `android.permissions.INTERNET`
              permission:

      ```xml lines
      <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
      ```


      Run **Sync Project with Gradle Files** inside Android Studio or execute
              `./gradlew clean assembleDebug` from the command line.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      For more information about using Gradle, check the [Gradle official documentation](https://gradle.org/getting-started-android-build/).
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      [Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login) is the easiest way to
              set up authentication in your application. We recommend using it for the best experience, best security and the
              fullest array of features.

      In the `onCreate` method, create a new instance of the `Auth0` class to hold user
              credentials.

      Create a `loginWithBrowser` method and use the `WebAuthProvider` class to authenticate
              with any connection you enabled on your application in the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/). Here, you can pass the scheme value that was used in the
              `auth0Scheme` manifest placeholder as part of the initial configuration.

      After you call the `WebAuthProvider#start` function, the browser launches and shows the login page.
              Once the user authenticates, the callback URL is called. The callback URL contains the final result of the
              authentication process.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your application that calls `loginWithBrowser`. When you click it, verify
                      that your Android application redirects you to the [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/universal-login) page and that you can now log in or sign up using a username
                      and password or a social provider.

      Once that's complete, verify that Auth0 redirects back to your app.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      Use `WebAuthProvider` to remove the cookie set by the browser at authentication time, so that the
              users are forced to re-enter their credentials the next time they try to authenticate.

      Add a `logout` method to your app to remove the user's session and log them out of the app. Here,
              you can pass the scheme value that was used in the `auth0Scheme` manifest placeholder as part of the
              initial configuration.

      Use the `WebAuthProvider` class to implement logout. This call opens the browser and navigates the
              user to the logout endpoint. If the user cancels the logout, consider redirected the user to their previous URL.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button to your app that calls `logout` and logs the user out of your application. When
                      you click it, verify that your Android app redirects you logout page and back again, and that you are no
                      longer logged in to your application.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[6].id} title={sections[6].title} stepNumber="7">
      Use the `AuthenticationAPIClient` class to [retrieve
                the user's profile from Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-profiles#user-profile-management-api-access). This requires:

      - The access token returned from the login phase
      - The `WebAuthProvider.login`must contain the `profile`scope

      You must specify the `email` scope if you need to retrieve the user's email address.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      This quickstart sets the `openid profile email` scopes by default during the login step
                        above.
      </Callout>

      The following demonstrates a function that can be used to retrieve the user's profile and show it on the
              screen:

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Call the `showUserProfile` function after login. Verify the `onSuccess` callback
                      returns the user's profile information.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

      ## Next Steps

      Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
