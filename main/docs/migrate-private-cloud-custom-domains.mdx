Beginning with Private Cloud release 1906, dedicated deployments will include the ability to fully utilize the [Auth0 Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains) feature.

Existing Private Cloud customers using <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domains">custom domains</Tooltip> are able to complete a migration of their Private Cloud custom domains to the Auth0 custom domains. New customers/deployments will automatically use the Auth0 custom domains features.

## Requirements

* A new DNS domain dedicated to the custom domain's origin server hostname. This could be a subdomain of your existing Auth0 domain (i.e., if your domain name is `*.auth.mydomain.com`, the new subdomain would be `*.cd.auth.mydomain.com`).
* A wildcard public SSL certificate for the new DNS domain.
* A layer 4 network load balancer. This could be the existing one used by your Private Cloud deployment. Please note that if you are using a layer 7 load balancer, you must add a layer 4 load balancer.
* A DNS record pointing to the layer 4 load balancer.

## Migration process

Current Private Cloud customers using the existing Private Cloud custom domains must migrate to the Auth0 custom domains to fully benefit from the available features.

The custom domains migration process involves three phases, each of which requires several steps.

### Communication phase

Before beginning the migration process, Auth0 will reach out to you to explain the migration process and discuss the following:

* The certificate management model you would like to use:
  Auth0 offers two certificate management models. To simplify the migration process, we suggest using one model for all of your tenants (though you can use a different certificate model for each tenant if necessary).
* The type of load balancer you are using (i.e. network (layer 4) or application (layer 7)). If your dedicated deployment is AWS-hosted, we will need to confirm the type of load balancer you are using. If you are using an application load balancer, you will need to provision an additional network load balancer.

Allocating new DNS resources to meet stated requirements (if necessary)You will need to have ready the edge domain name and accompanying SSL certificate, the CNAME host name, and the email address to be used as the Let's Encrypt contact.

### Infrastructure preparation phase

Auth0 will prepare your environment for migration on your behalf. During this stage, you will need to:

1. Set up the network load balancer
2. Set up your new DNS records
3. Validate and verify that your set up is correct

### Migration phase

The goal of the migration phase is to create custom domains that have all the new functionality and to update all dependencies to function correctly with your newly-created domain names.

The first step is to create new domains using the Auth0 Custom Domains feature.

Once done, you may have additional configuration steps, depending on the Auth0 features you use.

### Final configuration

Once you have completed all of the required modifications on your applications, a Managed Services Engineer will assist you in completing the migration process.
