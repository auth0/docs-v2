Once you've finished setting up your end-to-end test environment, you can manage how valid XAA applications can connect to each other in the Okta Admin Console.

<Frame>![](/docs/images/xaa/manage_xaa_in_okta.png)</Frame>

In the Okta Admin Console:

1. Navigate to **Applications > Applications** and select your Resource App (e.g. Todo0).
2. Under the **Manage Connections** tab, add:
	- Requesting Apps: applications that can connect to your SaaS application
	- Resource Apps: applications your SaaS application can connect to

For the end-to-end test environment, add Agent0, or the application you want to use for testing, as an authorized Requesting App.
