In this tutorial, we will see how you can use Lock to ask for consent information, and then save this input in the user's metadata. To learn more, read [Understand How Metadata Works in User Profiles](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/metadata).

If you would instead like to track consent using a custom UI, see [GDPR: Track Consent with Custom UI](/docs/secure/data-privacy-and-compliance/gdpr/gdpr-track-consent-with-custom-ui).

## Overview

We will configure a simple JavaScript Single-Page Application and a database connection (we will use Auth0's infrastructure, instead of setting up our own database).

Instead of building an app from scratch, we will [use Auth0's JavaScript Quickstart sample](/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs). We will also use Auth0's <Tooltip tip="Universal Login: Your application redirects to Universal Login, hosted on Auth0's Authorization Server, to verify a user's identity." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Universal+Login">Universal Login</Tooltip> pages so we can implement a Universal Login experience, instead of embedding the login in our app. To learn more about Universal Login, read [Auth0 Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login). To learn more about the differences between Universal Login and embedded login, read [Centralized Universal Login vs. Embedded Login](/docs/authenticate/login/universal-vs-embedded-login).

We will capture consent information, under various scenarios, and save this at the user's metadata.

All scenarios will save the following properties at the user's metadata:

* a `consentGiven` property, with true/false values, shows if the user has provided consent (true) or not (false)
* a `consentTimestamp` property, holding the Unix timestamp of when the user-provided consent

For example:

```json lines
{
  "consentGiven": "true"
  "consentTimestamp": "1525101183"
}
```






We will see three different implementations for this:

* one that displays links to other pages where the Terms & Conditions and/or privacy policy information can be reviewed
* one that adds custom fields at the signup widget and works for database connections
* one that redirects to another page where the user can provide consent, and works for social connections

## Configure the application

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and create a new application. Choose `Single Web Page Applications` as type.
2. Go to **Settings** and set the **Allowed Callback URLs** to `http://localhost:3000`.

   This field holds the set of URLs to which Auth0 is allowed to redirect the users after they authenticate. Our sample app will run at `http://localhost:3000` hence we set this value.
3. Copy the **Client Id** and **Domain** values. You will need them in a while.
4. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database) and create a new connection. Click **Create DB Connection**, set a name for the new connection, and click **Save**. You can also enable a social connection at [Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Social](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social) (we will enable Google login for the purposes of this tutorial).
5. Go to the connection's **Applications** tab and make sure your newly created application is enabled.
6. [Download the JavaScript SPA Sample](/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs).

## Option 1: Display Terms & Conditions link

In this section, we will customize the login widget to add a flag that users must check in order to sign up. The flag's label will include links to pages that display the Terms & Conditions and privacy policy.

This works both for database connections and social logins.

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Branding > Universal Login](https://manage.auth0.com/#/login_page).
2. Select the **Login** view, and enable the **Customize Login Page** toggle.
3. Locate the **Default Templates** dropdown, and select `Lock`. The code block will be pre-populated for you.
4. To add a field for the `consentGiven` metadata, use the `mustAcceptTerms` option. To include links to your Terms & Conditions and/or privacy policy pages, use the `languageDictionary` option. To learn more, read [Lock Configuration Options](/docs/libraries/lock/lock-configuration). The example below displays text that says `I agree to the terms of service and privacy policy` (including links to both pages) next to the flag:

   ```javascript lines
   //code reducted for simplicity
       var lock = new Auth0Lock(config.clientID, config.auth0Domain, {
         auth: {
           //code reducted for simplicity
         },
         languageDictionary: {
           signUpTerms: "I agree to the <a href='https://my-app-url.com/terms' target='_blank'>terms of service</a> and <a href='https://my-app-url.com/privacy' target='_blank'>privacy policy</a>."
         },
         mustAcceptTerms: true,
         //code reducted for simplicity
       });
   ```


   

   

   To see what this will look like, select the **Preview** view, then when Lock loads, select **Sign Up**.
5. This flag forces users to accept the terms before they can sign up, but it does not set any metadata. To save the user's selection in the `consentGiven` metadata property, [create a new Action](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action). Enter a descriptive **Name** for your Action (for example, `Set consent flag upon signup`), select the `Login / Post Login` trigger because you’ll be adding the Action to the Login flow, then select **Create**.
6. The following screen is the Actions code editor. Copy the following JavaScript code into it, then select **Save Draft** to save your changes:

   ```text lines
   exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
     const { consentGiven } = event.user.user_metadata || {};

     // short-circuit if the user signed up already
     if ( consentGiven ) {
       return;
     }

     // first time login/signup
     api.user.setUserMetadata("consentGiven", true);
     api.user.setUserMetadata("consentTimestamp", Date.now());
     return;
   }
   ```


   

   

   This code sets the `consentGiven` metadata to `true` if it is not already set (which means it's the first login after a signup).
7. From the Actions Code Editor sidebar, select Test (play icon), then select **Run** to [test your code](/docs/customize/actions/test-actions).
8. When you’re ready for the Action to go live, select **Deploy**.

Finally, add the Action you created to the [Login Flow](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/flows/login/). To learn how to attach Actions to Flows, read the "Attach the Action to a flow" section in [Write Your First Action](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action).

## Option 2: Add custom fields for database connections

In this section, we will customize the login widget to add a flag that users will check if they agree to the processing of their information.

This works only for database connections (if you use social logins, see the next paragraph).

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Branding > Universal Login](https://manage.auth0.com/#/login_page).
2. Select the **Login** view, and enable the **Customize Login Page** toggle.
3. Locate the **Default Templates** dropdown, and select `Lock`. The code block will be pre-populated for you.
4. To add a field for the `consentGiven` metadata, use the `additionalSignUpFields` option. To learn more, read [Lock Configuration Options](/docs/libraries/lock/lock-configuration). The example below sets the type to `checkbox` (so we have a flag), the label to `I consent to data processing`, and the default value to `checked`.

   ```javascript lines
   //code reducted for simplicity
       var lock = new Auth0Lock(config.clientID, config.auth0Domain, {
         auth: {
           //code reducted for simplicity
         },
         additionalSignUpFields: [{
           type: "checkbox",
           name: "consentGiven",
           prefill: "true",
           placeholder: "I consent to data processing"
         }],
         //code reducted for simplicity
       });
   ```


   

   
5. To see what this will look like, select the **Preview** view, and when Lock loads, select **Sign Up**.

Note that in this option, we only set the flag and not the timestamp. Displaying the current time in the login widget is not optimal, that's why we didn't add an additional signup field. What you should do is set the timestamp in the background, with a rule that will check the value of `consentGiven` and set the additional `consentTimestamp` metadata to the current timestamp.

## Option 3: Redirect to another page

If you are using social logins, adding custom fields is not an option, but you can redirect the user to another page where you ask for consent and any additional info, and then redirect back to finish the authentication transaction. This can be done with Redirect Actions. To learn more, read [Redirect with Actions](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/redirect-with-actions). We will use this same Action to save the consent information in the user's metadata, so we can track this information and not ask for consent upon the next login.

For simplicity, we will use a [sample consent form](https://github.com/auth0/rules/blob/master/redirect-rules/simple/webtask.js#L31). You will need to host this form, and the URL for the form must be publicly-accessible. You'll need to provide the URL where the form can be accessed to Auth0 in Step 2. If you need a specialized consent prompt (for example, a parental consent), you must build your own custom consent form. Be aware that laws vary according to country.

1. [Create a new Action](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action). Enter a descriptive **Name** for your Action (for example, `Redirect to consent form`), select the `Login / Post Login` trigger because you’ll be adding the Action to the Login flow, then select **Create**.
2. Locate the Actions Code Editor, and select the **Secrets** (key) icon in its sidebar. Add the consent form URL as a Secret by creating a key/value pair:

   * **Key**: `CONSENT_FORM_URL`
   * **Value**: `your-consent-form-url.com` (Be sure to provide the publicly-accessible URL where your consent form can be found.)
3. Copy the following JavaScript code into the Actions Code Editor, and select **Save Draft** to save your changes:

   ```text lines
   exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
       const { consentGiven } = event.user.user_metadata || {};

       // redirect to consent form if user has not yet consented
       if (!consentGiven && api.redirect.canRedirect()) {
         const options = {
           query: {
             auth0_domain: `${event.tenant.id}.auth0.com`,
           },
         };
         api.redirect.sendUserTo(event.secrets.CONSENT_FORM_URL, options);
       }
   };

   // if user clicks 'I agree' on the consent form, save it to their profile so they don't get prompted again
   exports.onContinuePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
     if (event.request.body.confirm === "yes") {
       api.user.setUserMetadata("consentGiven", true);
       api.user.setUserMetadata("consentTimestamp", Date.now());
       return;
     } else {
       return api.access.deny("User did not consent");
     }
   };
   ```


   

   
4. From the Actions Code Editor sidebar, select Test (play icon), then select **Run** to [test your code](/docs/customize/actions/test-actions).
5. When you’re ready for the Action to go live, select **Deploy**.

Finally, add the Action you created to the [Login Flow](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/flows/login/). To learn how to attach Actions to Flows, read the "Attach the Action to a flow" section in [Write Your First Action](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action).

When setting up redirection to your consent form for use in a Production environment, be sure to review [Trusted Callback URLs](https://github.com/auth0/rules/tree/master/redirect-rules/simple#trusted-callback-urls) and [Data Integrity](https://github.com/auth0/rules/tree/master/redirect-rules/simple#data-integrity) regarding security concerns.

We are done with the configuration part; let's test!

## Test the configuration

1. Go to the folder where you downloaded the application and run it.

   ```text lines
   npm install
       npm run
   ```


   

   
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`. Click **Login**. Once Lock is displayed, click **Sign Up**.
   The login page will be served by default at `YOUR_DOMAIN/login`. To learn how to use your own domain, read [Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains).
3. If you followed the first implementation option, you should see the flag to accept the terms of service and privacy policy. Note that the **Sign up** button remains disabled until you check the flag. Follow the links to check they are working. Set an email and password and accept the terms and click **Sign Up**. Alternatively, if you use a social connection, accept the terms, and choose **Sign Up with Google**.
4. If you followed the second implementation option, you should see the new custom field we added. Set an email and password and leave the `I consent to data processing` flag checked. Click **Sign Up**.
5. If you followed the third implementation option, choose **Sign Up with Google**. You will be navigated to the consent form. Check the **I agree** flag and click **Submit**.

   If you do not check the **I agree** flag before clicking **Submit**, then you will see a popup error `Unauthorized. Check the console for details.`. At the console you will see this JSON:

   ```json lines
   {
         error: "unauthorized", 
         errorDescription: "User did not consent!", 
         state: "q0GjMwzZN_q5r8XPHvfakkMYcYM2q1N3"
       }
   ```


   

   

   Note, that the user is created but they won't be able to log in. If they try to, they will be prompted again to provide consent.
6. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > User Management > Users](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users) and search for the new user.
7. Go to **User Details** and scroll down to the **Metadata** section. At the **user_metadata** text area you should see the following:

   ```json lines
   {
         "consentGiven": "true"
         "consentTimestamp": "1525101183"
       }
   ```


   

   

That's it; you are done!
