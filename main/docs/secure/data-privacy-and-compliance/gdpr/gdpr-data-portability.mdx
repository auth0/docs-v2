According to Article 20 of GDPR, users have the right to receive the personal data concerning them in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

You can export user data, stored in the Auth0 user store, either manually or programmatically. Raw data from Auth0 can be exported in JSON format (which is machine-readable).

## Export data manually

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > User Management > Users](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users).
2. Search for the user and drill down on their name.
3. Click the **Raw JSON** tab. Here you can see the complete user profile in JSON format.
4. Click **Copy JSON**. The profile is copied to your clipboard.
5. Paste the clipboard contents to an editor and save.

## Export data using the API

You can export a user's full profile using our <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.
