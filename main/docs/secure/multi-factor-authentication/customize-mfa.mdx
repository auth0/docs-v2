These customizations do not apply to Duo, which has its own user interface.

</Callout>

You can customize the <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> pages that appear to your users by adjusting the <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Universal+Login">Universal Login</Tooltip> branding options in the [Universal Login Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/login_settings) section of the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>.

If you are using the Universal Login experience, you can customize the page using its flow customization options.

You can also customize the full HTML content to reflect your organization's particular user experience requirements. To learn more, read [MFA Widget Theme Options](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa/mfa-widget-theme-options).

With the Universal Login Experience, MFA is presented even more simply to the user. Once they have entered their credentials to log in, they are presented with the MFA screen. If they have no MFA factor enrolled, they will be asked to enroll, and if they do, they will be asked to present their MFA credential.

## Use the MFA API

Auth0 provides an [MFA API](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-developer-resources/mfa-api) for the following scenarios:

* [Authenticate users with the Resource Owner Password Grant](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/authenticate-using-ropg-flow-with-mfa).
* Build an interface to [let users manage their own authentication factors](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/manage-mfa-auth0-apis/manage-authenticator-factors-mfa-api).
* Invite users to enroll in MFA using [enrollment tickets](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-developer-resources/create-custom-enrollment-tickets).

To use the MFA API, you must enable the MFA grant type for your application. To enable the MFA grant in the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Go to [Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and select your application.
2. At the bottom of the **Settings** tab, click **Advanced Settings**.
3. Click the **Grant Types** tab and select **MFA**.

   <Frame>![Dashboard Applications Applications Advanced Settings Grant Types tab](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/3knG7flXhvUi0b2yhH0JEp/007e84fe56a9828ea59e9d06e0516d34/Screen_Shot_2021-05-18_at_2.24.26_PM.png)</Frame>

   To learn more, read [Enable Multi-Factor Authentication](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/enable-mfa).
4. Click **Save Changes**.

### Limitations

The MFA API is designed to work with SMS, push notifications within the Guardian application, email, and OTP factors. It does not support enrolling with Duo.

## Customize MFA policy with Actions

You can use Actions to customize the MFA policy for your tenant, including requiring MFA for users of specific applications, users with specific user metadata or IP ranges, and more.

If you're unfamiliar with creating Actions, read [Write Your First Action](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Any and all MFA-related behavior defined in Actions take precedence over the **Define policy** settings configured in the **Multi-Factor Auth** section of the Dashboard.

To learn more, read [Enable Multi-Factor Authentication](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/enable-mfa).

</Callout>

When writing Actions, you can use the `provider` setting to specify whether to force MFA, and which factor you use. The behavior is different depending on whether you use the Classic or the Universal Login experience:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Provider</th>
<th>Classic Experience</th>
<th>New Experience</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>any</td>
<td>Push, SMS, or OTP</td>
<td>Push, SMS, Voice, OTP, Email, or WebAuthN security key (when enabled)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>guardian</td>
<td>Push, SMS, or OTP</td>
<td>Push, SMS, OTP, or Email</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>google-authenticator</td>
<td>Google Authenticator</td>
<td>Push, SMS, OTP, or Email</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>duo</td>
<td>Duo</td>
<td>Duo</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you are using Universal Login you can get the behavior of the Classic Login experience if you enable customization of the MFA login page.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

The `guardian` and `google-authenticator` options are legacy settings that are kept for backward compatibility reasons, and should not be used moving forward. We recommend using `any` instead. The `google-authenticator` option does not let users enroll a recovery code.

</Callout>

Setting the `provider` to a specific option manually overrides the enabled/disabled toggles in the Dashboard. You can use the following Action to prompt the user to enroll in Duo even if other factors are enabled in the Dashboard:

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
    // Forcing the provider to Duo programmatically
    api.multifactor.enable('duo')
}
```






## Common use case examples

Here are some common contextual MFA scenarios that can be handled by Actions.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

To ensure that your tenant triggers MFA only when you explicitly require it in your Actions, set your tenant's default MFA policy to **Never**.

For more information, read the "Policies" section in [Multi-Factor Authentication Factors](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors#policies).

</Callout>

### Require MFA for specific applications

You can customize MFA to only trigger when users are logging in to to specific applications.

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
	const CLIENTS_WITH_MFA = [
		'{yourClientId1}', 
		'{yourClientId2}',
		'{yourClientId3}'
	];

	if (CLIENTS_WITH_MFA.includes(event.client.client_id)) {
		api.multifactor.enable('duo', { allowRememberBrowser: false })
	}
}
```






### Require MFA for specific users

You can customize MFA to only trigger for users who are marked to use MFA.

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  if (event.user.user_metadata && event.user.user_metadata.use_mfa) {
    api.multifactor.enable('duo', { allowRememberBrowser: false });
  }
}
```






### Change frequency of MFA prompts

In some scenarios, you may not want to prompt the user for MFA each time they log in from the same browser. You can alter that behavior by using the `allowRememberBrowser` property:

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {  
  api.multifactor.enable('any', { allowRememberBrowser: false });
}
```






Depending on the property value the behavior will be as follows:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>true</code></td>
<td>When provider is set to <code>google-authenticator</code> or <code>duo</code>, the user is prompted for MFA once every 30 days. When provider is set to <code>guardian</code>, the MFA prompt displays the enrollment checkbox for users to choose whether or not to enroll. Defaults to <code>false</code>. To learn more, read <a href="/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa ">Customize Multi-Factor Authentication Pages </a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>false</code></td>
<td>The user is prompted for MFA each time they authenticate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The time values are for active users. If a user is inactive for a period of seven days or more, their cookie will expire and they will be prompted for MFA on their next login attempt (regardless if `allowRememberBrowser` is set to `true` and it has not been 30 days since their last MFA prompt).

When you allow the user to skip MFA, a cookie is stored in the user's browser. If the user has the cookie set but you still want to require MFA, you have two options:

* Set `allowRememberBrowser` to `false`
* Set `acr_values` to `http://schemas.openid.net/pape/policies/2007/06/multi-factor` when calling the `/authorize` endpoint.

In situations where a user loses a trusted device, you can prompt the specific user for MFA during their next login by calling the Auth0 <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> [Invalidate Remember Browser](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_invalidate_remember_browser) endpoint.

### Require MFA for users outside of the network

Assuming that access to the specified network of internal IP addresses is well controlled, you can also have Auth0 request MFA only from users whose requests originate from outside the corporate network:

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const ipaddr = require('ipaddr.js@1.9.0');
  const corp_network = '192.168.1.134/26';
  const current_ip = ipaddr.parse(event.request.ip);

  if (!current_ip.match(ipaddr.parseCIDR(corp_network))) {
    api.multifactor.enable('any', {allowRememberBrowser: false});
  }
}
```






### Bypass MFA for refresh token requests

If your users report frequent log-outs, you may need to bypass <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=refresh+token">refresh token</Tooltip> requests while using MFA. You can alter the default behavior with a filter Action on the `event.transaction.protocol` object property.

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  if (event.transaction.protocol !== 'oauth2-refresh-token') {
    // MFA-related commands here
    api.multifactor.enable('any');
  }
};
```
