Auth0 provides a built-in <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=multi-factor+authentication">multi-factor authentication</Tooltip> (MFA) enrollment and authentication flow using [Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login). Use the [MFA API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#multi-factor-authentication)  in the following scenarios if you want to:

* [Authenticate users with the Resource Owner Password Grant](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/authenticate-using-ropg-flow-with-mfa).
* Build an interface to let [users manage their own authentication factors](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/manage-mfa-auth0-apis/manage-authenticator-factors-mfa-api).

To use the MFA API, you must enable the MFA grant type for your application. To enable the MFA grant in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>, go to [Dashboard > Applications > Advanced Settings > Grant Types](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and select **MFA**. See [Enable Multi-Factor Authentication](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/enable-mfa) for details.

## Limitations

The MFA API is designed to work with SMS, Voice, push via the Auth0 Guardian app, email, and OTP factors. It does not currently support enrolling with Duo or WebAuthn.
