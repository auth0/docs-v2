## Compliance & Certifications

### FAPI

Auth0 supports technical requirements for [FAPI](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/), a set of advanced security profiles specified by the <Tooltip tip="OpenID: Open standard for authentication that allows applications to verify users' identities without collecting and storing login information." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OpenID">OpenID</Tooltip> Foundation. FAPI introduces stricter security standards for industries and scenarios that require more security on top of normal <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth+2.0">OAuth 2.0</Tooltip> and OpenID Connect (OIDC) implementations.

Auth0 is a certified FAPI OpenID Provider for the following two profiles:

* FAPI 1 Advanced OP with mTLS, PAR
* FAPI 1 Advanced OP with Private Key <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip>, PAR

For more information, see [FAPI OpenID Providers (OP) & Profiles](https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI-OP-P).
