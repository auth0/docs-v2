<Tooltip tip="Breached Password Detection: Form of attack protection in which Auth0 notifies your users if they use a username/password combination that has been compromised in a data leak on a third-party website or app." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Breached+password+detection">Breached password detection</Tooltip> protects your applications from <Tooltip tip="Breached Password Detection: Form of attack protection in which Auth0 notifies your users if they use a username/password combination that has been compromised in a data leak on a third-party website or app." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=bad+actors">bad actors</Tooltip> signing up or logging in with stolen credentials. Auth0 can both notify users and block at-risk accounts.

Auth0 tracks large security breaches that occur on major third-party sites. If Auth0 identifies that any of your users’ credentials were part of a breach, the breached password detection security feature triggers. In response, Auth0 can:

* Block new users from signing up with stolen credentials. Entirely blocks the username/password combination.
* Block anyone from logging in with stolen credentials. Entirely blocks the account and prevents bad actors from accessing your application. The user can’t log in until they change their password.
* Send an email to the user when a login attempt happens. The email informs users about the risk and instructs them to change their password immediately. You can customize the message sent to users. To learn more, read [Customize Blocked Account Emails](/docs/customize/email/customize-blocked-account-emails).

## Detect breaches faster with Credential Guard

Breached password detection relies on breach data released to the public. Credential Guard is an additional Auth0 service you can add to breach password detection that screens for breaches to allow faster notification of compromised credentials.

5. Select **Save** to apply changes.

### Configure response scenarios

You can configure how Auth0 responds to different scenarios when users may provide compromised credentials.

1. Go to [Dashboard > Security > Attack Protection](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/attack-protection) and select **Breached Password Detection**.
2. Locate the **Response** section.

   <Frame>![](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/6AWOwZZVAo9pDmeRYppcvn/44b87e4c9b73a681da20db5e16d6b32a/Configure_response_scenarios.png)</Frame>
3. Enable the **Block compromised credentials for new accounts** toggle to block users from using compromised credentials during signup.
4. Enable the **Block compromised user accounts** toggle to block users from using compromised credentials during login.
5. Enable the **Block compromised credentials use for password reset** toggle to block users from using compromised credentials upon password reset.

<Warning>

If you are using Lock, our UI widget for authenticating users, with the Classic Login experience, then you must update to v11.33.3 or higher to use breached password detection for new accounts. To learn more about Lock, navigate to the [Lock library](/docs/libraries#lock). If you are using an Auth0 SDK, then you must update to the newest version to use breached password detection for new accounts.

</Warning>

### Configure notifications

You can configure how Auth0 notifies users and admins about the use of compromised credentials.

1. Go to [Dashboard > Security > Attack Protection](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/attack-protection) and select **Breached Password Detection**.
2. Locate the **Notifications** section.
3. Enable the **Send notifications to users with compromised credentials** toggle to send an email to a user when Auth0 detects their credentials may have been compromised.
4. Enable the **Compromised user accounts** toggle to send an email to administrators when a user signs up with compromised credentials.
5. Enable the **Compromised user accounts** toggle to send an email to administrators when a user logs in with compromised credentials.
6. Choose the notification frequency: **Immediately**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.

   <Warning>

   If you choose **daily**, **weekly**, or **monthly**, your notification will include the number of breaches to your application. If you choose **immediate**, your notification will include the user account attempting to breach your application. Logs are throttled to 1 per hour.

   </Warning>
7. Select **Save**.

#### Customize email notifications to users

## Verify detection configuration

You can verify your configuration by testing signup and login flows with an Auth0-provided breached password.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Any password starting with `AUTH0-TEST-` triggers Breached Password Detection for testing purposes.

</Callout>

### Signup flow

Verify a user’s signup experience when Auth0 detects a breached password:

1. Go through your signup flow and try to register a new account with a test breached password (`Paaf213XXYYZZ` or `Paat739!!WWXXYYZZ`) or any password starting with `AUTH0-TEST-`.
2. If **Block compromised credentials for new accounts** is enabled, you will receive an error message, preventing you from using the breached password.
3. Navigate to [Dashboard > Monitoring > Logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs).
4. Search the logs for `type: "signup_pwd_leak"` to verify Auth0 blocked the signup.

### Login flow

Verify a user's login experience when Auth0 detects a breached password:

1. Create a test user in [Dashboard > User Management > User](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users), and assign a test breached password (`Paaf213XXYYZZ` or `Paat739!!WWXXYYZZ`) or any password starting with `AUTH0-TEST-`.
2. Go through your login flow and submit the identifier and password that you assigned.
3. If **Block compromised user accounts** is enabled, the user will receive an error message, preventing them from logging in and advising to reset their password.
4. Navigate to [Dashboard > Monitoring > Logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs).
5. Search the logs for `type: "pwd_leak"` to verify Auth0 blocked the login.
6. Navigate to [Dashboard > User Management > User](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users) to delete the test user.

### Reset flow

Verify a user's password reset experience when Auth0 detects a breached password:

1. Create a test user in [Dashboard > User Management > User](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users).
2. Go through your password reset flow and submit one of the test breached passwords (`Paaf213XXYYZZ` or `Paat739!!WWXXYYZZ`) or any password starting with `AUTH0-TEST-`.
