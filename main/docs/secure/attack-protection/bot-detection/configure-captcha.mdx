## hCaptcha

To learn more about hCaptcha and how to get configuration details, read [Switch from reCAPTCHA to hCaptcha on hCaptcha Docs](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/switch).

## Friendly Captcha

Friendly Captcha is a system for preventing spam on your website. You can add the Friendly Captcha widget to your web app to fight spam, with little impact to the user experience.

To learn more about Friendly Captcha and how to get configuration details, read [Installation on Friendly Captcha Docs](https://docs.friendlycaptcha.com/#/installation?id=installation).

## Arkose

Arkose Labs provides a bot detection solution for mitigating human-based and bot-driven attacks. For more information on seamlessly integrating with Arkose as your CAPTCHA provider, see [Arkose Bot Manager](https://www.arkoselabs.com/arkose-bot-manager/).

<Warning>

You must upgrade to Auth0.js v9.23+ to use Arkose as a CAPTCHA provider.

</Warning>

### Configure callback action with Auth0.js

When using Arkose as the CAPTCHA provider, the Auth0.js WebAuth clientâ€™s `renderCaptcha` method allows you to pass a callback function. The second parameter of the callback will be a payload object containing the `triggerCaptcha` function. The `triggerCaptcha` function can be used to configure how your application handles and renders the CAPTCHA prompt.

To learn more about configuring the `renderCaptcha` method, read [renderCaptcha](https://auth0.github.io/auth0.js/WebAuth.html#renderCaptcha) in the Auth0.js documentation.
