<Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+tokens">ID tokens</Tooltip> follow the [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) standard, which means that their basic structure conforms to the typical [JWT Structure](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-structure), and they contain standard [JWT Claims](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims) asserted about the token itself.

Beyond what is required for <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip>, ID tokens also contain claims asserted about the authenticated user, which are pre-defined by the <Tooltip tip="OpenID: Open standard for authentication that allows applications to verify users' identities without collecting and storing login information." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OpenID">OpenID</Tooltip> Connect (OIDC) protocol, and are thus known as standard OIDC claims. Some standard OIDC claims include:

* `name`
* `nickname`
* `picture`
* `email`
* `email_verified`

For a full list of standard OIDC claims, see [OIDC specification: Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). You can also create [custom claims](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims), which are claims that you define, control, and add to a token using Auth0 Actions.

You control which OIDC claims are included in the ID token consumed by your application by including specific [OpenID Connect Scopes](/docs/get-started/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes) in a parameter when you request tokens while authenticating users. To learn how to request an ID token, see [Get ID Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/id-tokens/get-id-tokens).

## Sample ID Token

This example shows the contents of an ID token. Notice that the <Tooltip tip="Audience: Unique identifier of the audience for an issued token. Named aud in a token, its value contains the ID of either an application (Client ID) for an ID Token or an API (API Identifier) for an Access Token." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=audience">audience</Tooltip> value (located in the `aud` claim) is set to the application's identifier, which means that only this specific application should consume the token. To learn more about the claims in this example, read [JSON Web Token Claims](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims).
