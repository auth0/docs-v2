Key Concepts

* Learn about token-based authentication.
* Read how Auth0 uses self-contained JSON Web Token (JWTs) access tokens that conform to JSON structure with standard claims.
* Review the provided access token sample and necessary parameters.
* Set access token lifetime based on the default.

<Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+tokens">Access tokens</Tooltip> are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API. The passed token informs the API that the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the <Tooltip tip="Scope: Mechanism that determines actions applications can perform on a user's behalf with information previously created in an online resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Scope">Scope</Tooltip> that was granted during authorization.

In addition, if you have chosen to allow users to log in through an <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Identity+Provider+%28IdP%29">Identity Provider (IdP)</Tooltip>, such as Facebook, the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=IdP">IdP</Tooltip> will issue its own access token to allow your application to call the IDP's API. For example, if your user authenticates using Facebook, the access token issued by Facebook can be used to call the Facebook Graph API. These tokens are controlled by the IdP and can be issued in any format. See [Identity Provider Access Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/identity-provider-access-tokens) for details.

## Opaque access tokens

Opaque access tokens are tokens in a proprietary format that you cannot access and typically contain some identifier to information in a server's persistent storage. To validate an opaque token, the recipient of the token needs to call the server that issued the token.

In Auth0's case, opaque tokens can be used with the `/userinfo` endpoint to return a user's profile. If you receive an opaque Access Token, you don't need to validate it. You can use it with the `/userinfo` endpoint, and Auth0 takes care of the rest. To learn more, see [Get Access Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/get-access-tokens).

## JWT access tokens

<Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JSON+Web+Token">JSON Web Token</Tooltip> (JWT) access tokens conform to the [JWT standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) and contain information about an entity in the form of claims. They are self-contained therefore it is not necessary for the recipient to call a server to validate the token.

Access tokens issued for the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> and access tokens issued for any custom API that you have registered with Auth0 follow the JWT standard, which means that their basic structure conforms to the typical [JWT structure](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-structure), and they contain standard [JWT claims](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims) asserted about the token itself.

### Management API access tokens

An access token issued for the Auth0 Management API should be treated as opaque (regardless of whether it actually is), so you don't need to validate it. You can use it with the Auth0 Management API, and Auth0 takes care of the rest. To learn more, see [Auth0 Management API Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens).

### Custom API access tokens

If validation of your custom API access token fails, make sure it was issued with your custom API as the `audience`. To learn more, see [Get Access Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/get-access-tokens).

## Sample access token

This example shows the contents of an access token. Notice that the token only contains authorization information about the actions the application is allowed to perform at the API (such permissions are referred to as `scopes`).

```json lines
{
  "iss": "https://my-domain.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|123456",
  "aud": [
    "https://example.com/health-api",
    "https://my-domain.auth0.com/userinfo"
  ],
  "azp": "my_client_id",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "scope": "openid profile read:patients read:admin"
}
```






The token does not contain any information about the user except for the user ID (located in the `sub` claim). In many cases, you may find it useful to retrieve additional user information. You can do this by calling the [userinfo API endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-user-info) with the Access Token. Be sure that the API for which the Access Token is issued uses the **RS256** [signing algorithm](/docs/get-started/applications/signing-algorithms).

## Access token security

You should follow [token best practices](/docs/secure/tokens/token-best-practices) when using access tokens, and for JWTs, make sure that you [validate an access token](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/validate-access-tokens) before assuming that its contents can be trusted.

## Access token lifetime

### Custom API token lifetime

By default, an access token for a custom API is valid for 86400 seconds (24 hours). We recommend that you set the validity period of your token based on the security requirements of your API. For example, an access token that accesses a banking API should expire more quickly than one that accesses a to-do API. To learn more, see [Update Access Token Lifetime](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/update-access-token-lifetime).

### /userinfo endpoint token lifetime

Access tokens issued strictly for the purpose of accessing the OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint have a default lifetime and can't be changed. The length of lifetime depends on the flow used to obtain the token:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Flow</th>
<th>Lifetime</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Implicit</td>
<td>7200 seconds (2 hours)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Authorization Code/Hybrid</td>
<td>86400 seconds (24 hours)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
