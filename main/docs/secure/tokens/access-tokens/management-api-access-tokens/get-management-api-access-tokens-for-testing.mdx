<Warning>

This method for obtaining Access Tokens is **only for test purposes**. Do not get manually long-lived tokens and use them in your applications because that nullifies the security advantages that tokens offer.

</Warning>

The first time you get a test token for the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> is when you complete the configuration in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>. You won't have to do this again unless you create a new tenant. We recommend that you create a test token exclusively for authorizing access to the Management API instead of reusing another one you might have.

## Prerequisites

* [Create Machine-to-Machine Applications for Testing](/docs/get-started/apis/create-m2m-app-test)

## Get Access Tokens Manually

1. On your Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to **Applications > APIs >**  [Auth0 Management API](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis/management/explorer). Select the **API Explorer** tab and locate an auto-generated token in the **Token** section.
2. Select the **Copy** icon to the right of the token. You can now make authorized calls to the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) using this token.

   <Frame>![APIs - Management API access tokens - Testing - Copy token](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/3Y4I9YJR77j73FCYDiegnC/44f32f76d27357bc39aad9ee7c4d5561/management-api-access-token.png)</Frame>
3. Optionally set the expiration time. By default, the token has an expiration time of 86400 seconds, which is 24 hours. After that period, the token expires and can no longer be used. To change the expiration time, update **Token Expiration (Seconds)** and click **Update & Regenerate Token**.

<Warning>

These tokens **cannot be revoked** so long expiration times are not recommended. Instead we recommend that you use short expiration times and issue a new one every time you need it. You can verify expiration by using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to decode the token.

</Warning>

## Use Access Tokens for Testing

You can use the <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip> you just created for testing purposes to manually call an endpoint through the [Management API Explorer](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

1. Visit the [Management API Explorer](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!), and select the **Set API Token** button.
2. Complete the **API Token** field. Additional information then displays on the popup, such as the scopes granted to the application.
3. Select **Set Token** to save your token and close the popup. Notice that the Set API Token button now displays as **Authorized**.
4. To begin testing, navigate to an endpoint you wish to call and enter any required or optional parameters in the fields to the right. Then, select **Test Endpoint**.
