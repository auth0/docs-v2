The JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) is a set of keys containing the public keys used to verify any <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JSON+Web+Token+%28JWT%29">JSON Web Token (JWT)</Tooltip> issued by the <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Authorization+Server">Authorization Server</Tooltip> and signed using the RS256 [signing algorithm](/docs/get-started/applications/signing-algorithms).

When creating applications and APIs in Auth0, two algorithms are supported for signing <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a userâ€™s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWTs">JWTs</Tooltip>: **RS256** and **HS256**. RS256 generates an asymmetric signature, which means a private key must be used to sign the JWT and a different public key must be used to verify the signature.

Auth0 uses the [JSON Web Key (JWK) specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) to represent the cryptographic keys used for signing RS256 tokens. This specification defines two high-level data structures: **JSON Web Key (JWK)** and **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)**. Here are the definitions from the specification:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>JSON Web Key (JWK)</strong></td>
<td>A JSON object that represents a cryptographic key. The members of the object represent properties of the key, including its value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)</strong></td>
<td>A JSON object that represents a set of JWKs. The JSON object MUST have a <code>keys</code> member, which is an array of JWKs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Auth0 exposes a JWKS endpoint for each tenant, which is found at `https://{yourDomain}/.well-known/jwks.json`. This endpoint will contain the JWK used to verify all Auth0-issued JWTs for this tenant.

<Warning>

Currently, Auth0 signs with only one JWK at a time; however, it is important to assume this endpoint could contain multiple JWKs. As an example, multiple keys can be found in the JWKS when [rotating application signing keys](/docs/get-started/tenant-settings/signing-keys/rotate-signing-keys).
