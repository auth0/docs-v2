Privileged Worker Token Exchange with Token Vault is currently in Beta. To learn more about Auth0’s product release cycle, read [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages). To participate in this program, contact [Auth0 Support](https://support.auth0.com/) or your Technical Account Manager.

Token Vault supports the [token exchange](/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault#supported-token-exchanges), which enables a client application to exchange a signed JWT (subject token) for an external provider’s access or refresh token (requested token).

When a privileged service worker (e.g. a backend application or service) needs a user’s access token to access an external provider, but the user is not present, that service worker cannot use a token exchange to access the Token Vault to call external APIs.

Instead, the privileged service worker can generate a signed JWT bearer token and use that as the subject token to perform the token exchange. This means the privileged worker can perform actions on the user’s behalf without an active user interaction or session.

The service worker is a highly privileged client that can also request the refresh token from the Token Vault. As a result, the privileged worker must authenticate strongly with the Token Vault using asymmetric cryptographic methods such as [Private Key JWT](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authenticate-with-private-key-jwt) assertion or [mutual TLS authentication](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authenticate-with-mtls).

## Retrieve an external provider-issued refresh token from Token Vault

### Prerequisites

Before using the Privileged Worker Token Exchange with Token Vault, make sure your client application is:
* A first-party client. 
* A confidential client.
* Configured for Private Key JWT authentication or mutual TLS authentication.

### Configure client application
