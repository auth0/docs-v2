## Overview

A vulnerability has been identified in the [auth0.js JavaScript library](/docs/libraries/auth0js), affecting versions < `8.12`.

If your site or application uses a popup callback page with `auth0.popup.callback()` then an attacker can take advantage of unrestricted cross-origin post message requests and gain access to the tokens of logged-in users. A malicious website could then use any acquired <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Tokens">Access Tokens</Tooltip> to invoke services on behalf of the user.

This update addresses the vulnerability by implementing origin verification so the message cannot be posted to a page that is not in a specified domain. If no domain is specified, only the domain where the callback page is hosted is allowed. An attacker would receive a cross-origin request error.

Patching this vulnerability requires a library upgrade.

## Am I affected?

If the following apply you are affected by this vulnerability:

* You use a version of auth0.js lower than `8.12`
* You use a popup callback page with `auth0.popup.callback()` in your code

## How to fix that?

Developers using the auth0.js library need to upgrade to the latest version: `8.12`.

Updated packages are available on npm. To ensure delivery of additional bug fixes moving forward, please make sure your `package.json` file is updated to take patch and minor level updates of our libraries.

```json lines
{
  "dependencies": {
    "auth0-js": "^8.12.0"
  }
}
```






### Will this update impact my users?

No. This fix patches the library that your application runs, but will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.
