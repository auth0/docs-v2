## Overview

All versions of [Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT/) NuGet package lower than 1.0.4 include sensitive information about the expected <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip> signature in an error message emitted when JWT signature validation fails:

`Invalid signature. Expected 8Qh5lJ5gSaQylkSdaCIDBoOqKzhoJ0Nutkkap8RgB1Y= got 8Qh5lJ5gSaQylkSdaCIDBoOqKzhoJ0Nutkkap8RgBOo=`

This vulnerability allows attackers to use this error message to obtain a valid signature for arbitrary JWT tokens. This way attackers can forge tokens to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if the following conditions apply:

* You use a version of [Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT/) NuGet package lower than 1.0.4
* You show signature verification exception message in the user interface or make it otherwise available to the attacker (for example through logs or diagnostic messages)

## How to fix that?

Developers using the [Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT/) library need to upgrade to the latest version 1.0.4.

The updated package is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org): `Install-Package Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT -Version 1.0.4`

### Will this update impact my users?

No. This fix patches the library that your application runs, but will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.
