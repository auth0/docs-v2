## Overview

Versions before and including `11.25.1` are using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to display an informational message when used with a <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> or Enterprise connection.

* For a Passwordless connection, the value of the input (email or phone number) is displayed back to the user while waiting for verification code input.
* For an Enterprise connection, the value of the input (<Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=IdP">IdP</Tooltip> Domain) from the Enterprise connection setup screen (<Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>) is displayed back to the user when the Lock widget opens.

When a Passwordless or Enterprise connection is used, the application and its users might be exposed to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
