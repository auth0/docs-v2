**Auth0.Android** includes the `WebAuthProvider` class to handle the authorize flow using the Browser. But what if you want to use your own implementation or a Native version of an `AuthProvider`?

## The AuthProvider class

Create a class that implements the `AuthProvider` interface and override its methods.

You can also use any **Native** implementation already provided by Auth0. The [native social authentication](/docs/libraries/lock-android/lock-android-native-social-authentication) providers currently available are Google and Facebook.
