## Add login to your Android application

You can log the user in using the `WebAuthProvider.login` method:

```kotlin lines
WebAuthProvider.login(account)
  .withScheme(getString(R.string.com_auth0_scheme))
  .withScope("openid profile email")
  .start(this, object : Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
    override fun onFailure(exception: AuthenticationException) {
       // Authentication failed
     }

      override fun onSuccess(credentials: Credentials) {
         // Authentication succeeded
       }
  })
```

The authentication result will be delivered to the `onSuccess` callback.

See the [Auth0.Android configuration](/docs/libraries/auth0-android/auth0-android-configuration) for more options for the `WebAuthProvider` class.

## Add logout to your Android application

To log the user out, call the `WebAuthProvider.logout` method. The result of logout will be supplied in the `onSuccess` callback.

This method removes the cookie that the browser set at authentication time, so it forces users to re-enter their credentials the next time they try to authenticate.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If the logout is cancelled, you might want to take the user back to where they were before attempting to log out.

</Callout>

```kotlin lines
WebAuthProvider.logout(account)
  .withScheme("demo")
  .start(this, object: Callback<Void?, AuthenticationException> {
    override fun onSuccess(payload: Void?) {
      // The user has been logged out!
    }

    override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
      // Something went wrong!
    }
  })
```

## Show the user's profile

Use the `AuthenticationAPIClient` class to retrieve the user's profile from Auth0. This requires:

* The <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip> as received during the login phase
* The `profile` scope to include when `WebAuthProvider.login` is called
* The `email` scope (if you want to retrieve the user's email address)

This sample demonstrates a function that retrieves the user's profile and displays it on screen:

```kotlin lines
var client = AuthenticationAPIClient(account)

// Use the received access token to call `userInfo` and get the profile from Auth0.
client.userInfo(accessToken)
  .start(object : Callback<UserProfile, AuthenticationException> {
      override fun onFailure(exception: AuthenticationException) {
          // Something went wrong!
      }

      override fun onSuccess(profile: UserProfile) {
        // We have the user's profile!
        val email = profile.email
        val name = profile.name
      }
})
```
