'twitter:title': Auth0 Android v2 Migration Guide
---
Version 2 of the Auth0 Android SDK includes many improvements for integrating Auth0 into your Android application. **This upgrade contains breaking changes.** Please review this guide to understand the changes required when migrating to v2.

## Requirements changes

v2 requires Android API version 21 or later and Java 8+.

Here’s what you need in `build.gradle` to target Java 8 byte code for Android and Kotlin plugins respectively:

```kotlin lines
android {
  compileOptions {
      sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
      targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }

  kotlinOptions {
      jvmTarget = '1.8'
  }
}
```

## Open ID Connect only

v2 only supports OIDC-Conformant applications. When using this SDK to authenticate users, only the current Auth0 authentication pipeline and endpoints will be used. We removed the `setOIDCConformant(boolean value)` method from the `Auth0` class.

Learn more about the [OpenID Connect Protocol](/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol).

## Authorization Code with PKCE

v2 only supports the [Authorization Code with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) flow. We removed the `withResponseType(@ResponseType int type)` method on `WebAuthProvider.Builder`.

## Removal of WebView support

We removed the deprecated ability to authenticate using a `WebView` component. External browser applications will always be used instead for increased security and user trust.

## Removal of legacy authentication API support

We removed methods and classes specific to calling any [authentication APIs](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication) categorized as Legacy. See the complete list in the **Classes and interfaces removed** section below.

## Request interfaces changes

The `com.auth0.android.request` package defines the top-level interfaces for building and executing HTTP requests. Historically, a common issue has been the inability to add custom headers and request parameters to all request types. We've refactored the request interfaces to enable any request to be customized with additional headers and request parameters. Note that these parameters now need to be of type `String`.

The top-level `Request` interface now specifies these methods:

* `public fun addParameters(parameters: Map<String, String>): Request<T, U>`
* `public fun addParameter(name: String, value: String): Request<T, U>`
* `public fun addHeader(name: String, value: String): Request<T, U>`

We removed these interfaces:

* `ParameterizableRequest`
* `AuthRequest`

`AuthenticationAPIClient` contains many changes to the return type of methods as a result. These are some examples:

* Any methods that returned `ParameterizableRequest`, `TokenRequest`, or `DatabaseConnectionRequest`, now return a `Request`

* Any method that returned `AuthRequest` now returns `AuthenticationRequest`

If you are using the return type of any of these methods directly, you must change your code to expect the type as documented above. If you are chaining a call to `start` or `execute` to make the request, no changes are required.

The `AuthenticationRequest` interface no longer has a `setAccessToken("{ACCESS-TOKEN}")` method. This method was for setting the token to the request made to the [/oauth/access\_token](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#social-with-provider-s-access-token) Authentication API legacy endpoint, disabled as of June 2017. If you need to send a parameter with this name, please use `addParameter("access_token", "{ACCESS-TOKEN}")`.

Any classes that implemented `ParameterizableRequest` or `AuthRequest` have been updated to accommodate these changes.

See the complete list in the **Classes and interfaces removed** section below.

## Networking client customization

v2 improves the ability to customize the way this library makes HTTP requests. A new interface, `NetworkingClient`, defines the contract for executing HTTP requests. You can configure `Auth0` class with an instance of `NetworkingClient`. This lets you provide your own implementation for complete control over the networking client. Additionally, the default networking client provided by this library supports several sample customization points to enable easy configuration of common customization points.

### Timeout configuration

```kotlin lines
// Before
val account = Auth0("{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_DOMAIN}")

account.connectTimeoutInSeconds = 30
account.readTimeoutInSeconds = 30

val authAPI = AuthenticationAPIClient(account)

// After
val netClient = DefaultClient(
    connectTimeout = 30,
    readTimeout = 30
)

val account = Auth0("{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_DOMAIN}")
account.networkingClient = netClient
```

### Logging configuration

```kotlin lines
// Before
val account = Auth0("{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_DOMAIN}")
account.isLoggingEnabled = true

val authAPI = AuthenticationAPIClent(account)

// After
val netClient = DefaultClient(
    enableLogging = true
)

val account = Auth0("{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_DOMAIN}")
account.networkingClient = netClient
```

## Detailed change listing

### Files that changed their package

* We moved the `com.auth0.android.authentication.request.ProfileRequest` class to `com.auth0.android.request.ProfileRequest`.
* We moved the `com.auth0.android.authentication.request.SignUpRequest` class to `com.auth0.android.request.SignUpRequest`.

### Internal package

The previous version of this library exposed a few classes in the `com.auth0.android.request.internal` package. These were never meant to be part of the library's Public API; Java documentation discouraged their direct use. Since the codebase had migrated to Kotlin, we now take advantage of the `internal` modifier and use it where necessary. These classes might appear as `public` classes for Java projects, but do not use them. They are still not part of this library's Public API.

We will not provide support for these classes. We will change these as required without notice.

### Classes and interfaces removed

* The `com.auth0.android.util.Base64` class has been removed. Use `android.util.Base64` instead.

* `BaseCallback` has been deprecated; use `Callback` instead.

### Constructors changed

* You can no longer construct `AuthenticationAPIClient` from a `Context`. Use `AuthenticationAPIClient(auth0: Auth0)`instead. You can create an instance of `Auth0` using a `Context`.
* You can no longer construct `UsersAPIClient` from a `Context`. Use `UsersAPIClient(auth0: Auth0, token: String)` instead. You can create an instance of `Auth0` using a `Context`.
* `SignupRequest` now requires the second parameter to be an `AuthenticationRequest`.
* `ProfileRequest` now requires an `AuthenticationRequest` and a `Request<UserProfile, AuthenticationException>`.
* You can no longer construct `Credentials` with an "expires in" value. Give the date of expiration or "expires at" instead. You typically won't construct `Credentials` on your own.

### Methods removed or changed

#### Auth0 methods removed

* `setOIDCConformant(boolean enabled)` and `isOIDCConformant()` have been removed. The SDK now only supports OIDC-Conformant applications.

* `setWriteTimeoutInSeconds(seconds)` and `getWriteTimeoutInSeconds(seconds)` have been removed. There is no replacement.
* `setReadTimeoutInSeconds(seconds)` and `getReadTimeoutInSeconds(seconds)` have been removed. You can customize the read timeout directly on the `DefaultClient` class. Use `DefaultClient(readTimeout = 123)`.
* `setConnectTimeoutInSeconds(seconds)` and `getConnectTimeoutInSeconds(seconds)`have been removed. You can customize the connect timeout directly on the `DefaultClient` class. Use `DefaultClient(connectTimeout = 123)`.
* `setLoggingEnabled(boolean enabled)` and `isLoggingEnabled()` have been removed. You can enable the network traffic logger directly on the `DefaultClient` class. Use `DefaultClient(enableLogging = true)`. Use it for debugging purposes and never enable it on production environments.

#### RequestFactory methods removed or changed

The `RequestFactory` class contains methods to facilitate making HTTP requests, including the serialization and deserialization of the JSON request body and response. As part of the `com.auth0.android.request.internal` package, it is not intended for public use, but as a public type, the summary of changes is described below.

* All request methods have been refactored to be decoupled from a specific HTTP request library (for example, `OkHttp`)
* All request methods now return a `Request`.
* All request methods are now lowercase (for example, `POST()` -> `post()`).
* The `authenticationPOST` method was removed without a replacement, as all `Request` instances can be parameterized with any headers as needed.

#### ProfileRequest methods changed

* The `addParameters` method now requires the value to be Map of String to String, instead of String to Object (`addParameters(mapOf("key" to "val"))`)
