The Auth0 ACUL JS SDK lets you build custom Universal Login experiences with mininal effort. Whether you are working with login, signup, passwordless, or passkey enrollment, this SDK is built to handle modern authentication flows with ease. 

### Why Choose the Auth0 ACUL JS SDK?

* **Fast Integration:** Drop in pre-built screens like `login-id` or `signup-password`.
* **Modern Features:** Support passwordless, passkeys, and social logins. 
* **Flexible Modules:** Import only what you need. 
* **Unified State Management:** Use a single transaction object to handle all authentication flows.

### Architecture

#### How it works? 

The SDK is built with modularity and scability in mind. Here is how it fits together:

* **Screens:** Each authentication flow, such as `login-id` and `signup-password`, is a standalone module. 
* **Submit Handlers:** Manage form submissions and transitions.
* **Dynamic Forms:** Adapt fields and validations based on screen configurations.
* **Helper Properties:** Access common data, such as branding or transcation, in consistent way.
