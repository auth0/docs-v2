In authentication, a user or application proves they are who they say they are by providing valid credentials. The most common verification is password, often combined with other methods, such as a fingerprint.

Auth0 simplifies the use of open industry standards like OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and SAML to authenticate. Users can log into your applications with social media credentials, corporate accounts, and a broad range of other credentials.
