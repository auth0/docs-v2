<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Private Key JWT Client Authentication for OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Okta Workforce connections is currently available in [Early Access](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages). By using this feature, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/legal/).

</Callout>

Private Key <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip> Client Authentication is an alternative method of client authentication for <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OpenID">OpenID</Tooltip> Connect (OIDC) and Okta Workforce enterprise connections. While client authentication is most commonly handled by passing a shared <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+secret">client secret</Tooltip>, Private Key JWT Client Authentication instead passes a signed JWT for improved application security.

By using this feature, you can avoid some common security shortcomings often seen with standard client secret authentication, such as:

* An increased risk of interception and re-use, as client secrets must be transmitted between parties for every request.
* Limited mechanisms available to enforce expiration and prevent re-use by malicious actors.
* An increased risk of leaks or exposure due to both parties holding the client secret.

You can set up Private Key JWT Client Authentication for your OIDC and Okta Workforce enterprise connections through either the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> or the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.

## How it works

The OIDC Connection flow uses authenticated endpoints such as `/oauth/token` or `/oauth/par` to verify a client’s identity against the <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a user’s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+server">authorization server</Tooltip> or OpenID provider. With Private Key JWT Client Authentication, a signed client assertion JWT is passed to the OpenID provider instead of a client secret.

The client assertion JWT contains the following claims:

* An `aud` (<Tooltip tip="Audience: Unique identifier of the audience for an issued token. Named aud in a token, its value contains the ID of either an application (Client ID) for an ID Token or an API (API Identifier) for an Access Token." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=audience">audience</Tooltip>) identifying the OpenID provider’s <Tooltip tip="Audience: Unique identifier of the audience for an issued token. Named aud in a token, its value contains the ID of either an application (Client ID) for an ID Token or an API (API Identifier) for an Access Token." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=token+endpoint">token endpoint</Tooltip>.
* A `jti` (JWT ID) to enable one-time use or replay protection.
* An `exp` (expiration time) that limits the token’s validity window.
* A `sub` and `iss` identifying the <Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+ID">client ID</Tooltip>.

Private Key JWT Client Authentication offers a more secure method of authentication by eliminating the use of shared client secrets. Instead, the JWT is signed using the client’s private key, and the OpenID provider only has access to the public key.

### Private Key JWT Client Authentication Flow

After a user completes authentication with an upstream <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> (IdP), the user is redirected to Auth0 with an authorization code that is exchanged for tokens at the OpenID provider’s token endpoint. When Private Key JWT is enabled for a connection, the call to the OpenID provider’s token endpoint uses a client assertion instead of a client secret for a more secure authentication.

The following steps demonstrate a typical Private Key JWT Client Authentication flow.

<Frame>![A diagram mapping the Private Key JWT Client Authentication flow. ](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/4JOxbdG7aweqpDHCJ8VOZq/aea18936c0cbdbfbb39d0cd79af3987e/Client_Assertion_JWT_-_Diagram.png)</Frame>

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

To complete this flow, you must first configure a new or existing OIDC or Okta Workforce connection with `token_endpoint_auth_method=private_key_jwt` through either your Auth0 Dashboard or the Management API. To learn more, review the [Configure Private Key JWT Client Authentication](#configure-private-key-jwt-client-authentication) section.

</Callout>

1. After configuring your connection, Auth0 automatically generates and stores two public and private key pairs.

   * One key pair is the active `current` set, while the other set is labeled as `next` to support [key rotation](#rotate-signing-keys).
2. Depending on your IDP, you next either:

   * Download the `current` public key and upload the file to the Authorization Server, or:
   * Copy and paste the [`jwks_uri`](#retrieve-signing-keys) to the Authorization Server.
3. A user performs an action that requires authentication, such as logging in to your application.
4. Auth0 sends a request to the Authorization Server to initiate authentication.
5. The Authorization Server displays authentication and consent screens to the user.
6. The user authenticates and provides consent to the Authorization Server.
7. The Authorization Server sends an authorization code to Auth0.
8. Auth0 generates a client assertion JWT and signs it using the `current` private key.
9. Auth0 passes the client assertion JWT to the Authorization Server.
10. The Authorization Server looks up the client based on the provided `client_id`.
11. The Authorization Server fetches public keys from Auth0 if a `jwks_uri` was provided; otherwise, the server identifies the public key registered in step 2.
12. If the `jwks_uri` was requested, Auth0 returns the public keys as JWKS.
13. The Authorization Server validates the JWT by verifying the signature with the `current` public key, identified by `kid` in the header of the `client_assertion` JWT.
14. The Authorization Server generates an access token.
15. The Authorization Server passes the access token to Auth0.
16. Using the access token, Auth0 requests a resource from the Resource Server.
17. The Resource Server provides the resource to complete the flow.

## Configure Private Key JWT Client Authentication

You can configure OIDC and Okta Workforce enterprise connections to use Private Key JWT Client Authentication through either the Auth0 Dashboard or Management API. Steps for each method are provided below.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

* Private and public signing key pairs are automatically generated by Auth0 per connection.
* You can currently only use the RS256 algorithm for signing client assertion JWTs.
* Signed JWTs expire automatically after 60 seconds.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Public JWKS URI">

Some identity providers allow public keys for private_key_jwt to be provided in the form of a public JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) URI.

If public keys have been generated for a connection, you can retrieve them by adding the following URI to your IdP configuration:

```http wrap lines
https://{auth0 domain}/oauth/connection/{connection name}/.well-known/jwks.json
```






<Warning>

JWKS URIs count towards global rate limits. You can use caching of public keys to avoid reaching these limits. As best practice, Auth0 recommends a cache interval of at least 5-10 minutes to avoid calling the JWKS URI endpoint with each login attempt.

</Warning>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Rotate Signing Keys

Private Key JWT Client Authentication supports signing key rotation for increased security compared to the static, long-lived nature of shared client secrets. Rotating signing keys enhances security by limiting the exposure time of any single key, reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker to compromise it. It also allows for rapid response in the wake of a security incident.

To avoid disruption, Auth0 recommends rotating signing keys after one year. You can use either the Auth0 Dashboard or the Management API to rotate signing keys:


<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Auth0 Dashboard">

To rotate your signing keys through the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Navigate to [Authentication > Enterprise](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/enterprise).
2. Next to **OpenID Connect** or **Okta Workforce**, select **Browse**.
3. Choose the appropriate connection. Then, access its **Credentials** tab.
4. In the **Credentials** section, select **Rotate Keys**.
5. On the popup, select **Save** to confirm the rotation.

After rotation, any in-flight JWTs signed with the previous key immediately become inactive and may fail verification with your IdP.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Management API">

To view public keys through the Management API, call the Rotate Connection Signing Keys endpoint using the ID of your connection.

<Warning>

Use of this endpoint requires both `create:connections_keys` and `update:connections_keys` scopes.

</Warning>

```js lines
POST /v2/connections/{id}/keys/rotate
```






After rotation, any in-flight JWTs signed with the previous key immediately become inactive and may fail verification with your IdP.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>


<Card title="Understanding key rotation">

On your OIDC or Okta Workforce connection, your signing keys are assigned one of the following statuses:

* **Current**: The signing key currently in use for the application.
* **Next**: The next signing key to use for the application after the current key is revoked.
* **Previous**: An expired or otherwise revoked signing key that is no longer in use.

When Private Key JWT Client Authentication is first enabled for a connection, only a `current` and `next` keypair is generated. A key is only marked as `previous` after rotation occurs.

When rotating signing keys, the following changes occur:

1. The `current` key is removed and revoked, and any JWTs signed with this key will fail verification with the IdP if the IdP was configured with the `jwks_uri`.
2. The `current` key is assigned the `previous` status.
3. The `next` key becomes the active key and is given the `current` status. Going forward, client assertion JWTs will be signed with this key.
4. A new signing key is automatically generated to replace the rotated key. The new signing key has the `next` status.
