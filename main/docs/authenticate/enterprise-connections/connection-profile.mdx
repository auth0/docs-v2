Auth0 provides Enterprise connections to authenticate users in an external, federated identity provider (IdP) such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, and others. A configured connection will include protocol-specific settings for integrating single sign-in (SSO), user provisioning, and logout integrations with the external IDP, as well as private settings that govern how the connection interacts with Auth0’s Universal Login and Organizations features.
The Connection Profile (CP) enables Auth0 developers to specify how the private settings of an Auth0 connection should be configured when created by third parties

## How it works

*   **Profile Definition**
    An administrator creates a Connection Profile that defines the property values that should be written to the connection whenever they are created using one of Auth0 delegated administration features. 

*   **Flexible Scope**
    Profiles are linked to Self-Service SSO and Okta Express Configuration flows today but are designed for broader reuse, covering provisioning, onboarding, entitlement management, and future Auth0 capabilities.

## Connection profile properties
A connection profile is a JSON object that supports these configurable properties, which are applied to all newly created connections.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| ----- | ------- |
|`organization`|  An object containing settings that are applied to the organization under which the connection is created. |
| `organization.show_as_button` | Specifies whether the connection should be shown as a button on the login screen once an organization has been chosen. This maps to the show_as_button value on the enabled connection. |
| `organization.assign_membership_on_login` |<Note> For Express Configuration integrations with Okta, `optional` is treated as `required`</Note>  |
| `connection_name_prefix_template` ||
| `enabled_features` ||
