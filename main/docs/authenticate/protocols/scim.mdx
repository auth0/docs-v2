SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a set of application-level protocols to securely manage and communicate user data across multiple domains. SCIM clients can be integrated to manage CRUD (create, replace, update, delete) operations, apply queries and filters, and create user groups within your organization. SCIM allows you to automate user lifecycles and maintain user accounts across platforms.

To read the SCIM specification, read [System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7643/).

### SCIM with Auth0

Auth0 supplies an extensible, flexible directory designed to support CIAM use cases and focuses on simplifying identity for direct-to-consumer and software-as-a-service applications.

In an Auth0 tenant, you can use isolated directories via Enterprise, Social, or Database connections. To learn more about available connections, read [Identity Providers](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers) or [Database Connections](/docs/authenticate/database-connections).

Auth0 supports inbound SCIM for selected Enterprise <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Identity+Providers">Identity Providers</Tooltip>.
