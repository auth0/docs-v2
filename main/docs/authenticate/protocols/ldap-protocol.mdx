title: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
---
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an application protocol, used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The function of LDAP is to enable access to an existing directory like Active Directory (AD). Auth0 uses an [Active Directory/LDAP Connector](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/active-directory-ldap/ad-ldap-connector) that you install on your network to integrate with AD/LDAP.
