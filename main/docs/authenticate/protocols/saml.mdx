The <Tooltip tip="Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): Standardized protocol allowing two parties to exchange authentication information without a password." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Security+Assertion+Markup+Language">Security Assertion Markup Language</Tooltip> (SAML) protocol is an open-standard, XML-based framework for authentication and authorization between two entities without a password:

* **Service provider** (SP) agrees to trust the <Tooltip tip="Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): Standardized protocol allowing two parties to exchange authentication information without a password." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> to authenticate users.
* **Identity provider** (IdP) authenticates users and provides to service providers an authentication assertion that indicates a user has been authenticated.

Auth0 supports the SAML protocol and can serve as the IdP, the SP, or both including:

* SAML2 web applications
* SAML <Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=SSO">SSO</Tooltip> integrations
