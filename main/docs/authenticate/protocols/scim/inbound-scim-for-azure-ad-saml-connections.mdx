<Card title="Before you start">
To use this feature, your Auth0 plan or custom agreement must include Enterprise Connections. To learn more, read [Auth0's Pricing Page](https://auth0.com/pricing).

To test an inbound SKIM connection, you need to install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) locally.
</Card>

To provision users to your Auth0 SCIM endpoint, you need to configure a non-gallery enterprise application in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

## Configure SCIM settings in Auth0

1. From the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), go to **Authentication > Enterprise > SAML > [your-connection] > Provisioning**.
2. Toggle **Sync user profiles using SCIM** to on. This opens a new section on the same page with additional configuration.
3. In the **Mapping** tab, set **SCIM attribute containing the User ID** to **userName**.
4. In the **Additional Mappings** section, enter the following JSON:
    ```json lines
    {
        "scim": "emails[type eq \"work\"].value",
        "auth0": "email"
    },
    ```
    You can also view the [attribute mapping](/docs/authenticate/protocols/scim/configure-inbound-scim#attribute-mapping) and make sure the extended SCIM attributes are mapped to your preferred Auth0 attributes. 
5. When you're done, click **Save Changes**.

## Retrieve SCIM endpoint URL and token

To configure SCIM in a Microsoft Entra ID tenant, you need a SCIM endpoint URL and token from Auth0. You can get these values from the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. From the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), go to **Authentication > Enterprise > SAML > [your-connection] > Provisioning**.
2. In the **Sync user profiles using SCIM > Setup** section, copy the **SCIM Endpoint URL**.
3. In the same section, under **Bearer Token**, click **Generate New Token**. Choose the token's expiration date and scopes, then click **Generate Token**. The default requires scopes used by Azure AD are `get:users`, `post:users`, `patch:users`, and `delete:users`.
4. Copy the bearer token. For security, this is the only time the token is visible.

You can also get these values programmatically using the Management API's SKIM endpoints, such as [`/v2/connections/{id}/skim-configuration/tokens`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-scim-tokens).

For best practices, read the [Configure Inbound SCIM deployment guidelines](/docs/authenticate/protocols/scim/configure-inbound-scim#deployment-guidelines).

## Configure SCIM in Entra ID for SAML Apps

If your SAML application is not already registered, follow [Configure IdP-Initiated SAML Login with Azure as the IdP](https://support.auth0.com/center/s/article/Configure-IdP-Initiated-SAML-Login-with-Azure-as-the-IdP) to register a custom, non-gallery enterprise application in an Entra ID tenant.

Then, to configure SCIM:

1. From the Microsoft Entra admin center, go to **Entra ID > Enterprise apps > [your-application]**.
3. Go to **Manage > Properties** and set **Assignment Required** to **Yes**.
4. Go to **Manage > Users and Groups** and assign the Azure AD users you want to provision. When you assign a group, the users from that group are provisioned.
4. Go to **Manage > Provisioning** and select **Get started**.
5. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.
6. Expand the **Admin Credentials** section and configure the following parameters:
    * Set the **Tenant URL** field to the SCIM endpoint URL you saved in the previous step, and append the query parameter `?aadOptscim062020` to the end of the URL. This is [Microsoft's recommended workaround for a known SKIM 2.0 issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-scim-compatibility).
    * Set the **Secret Token** to the token value you saved in the previous step, then select **Save**.
9. Expand the **Mappings** section, then select **Provision Azure Active Directory Users** to open the **Attribute Mapping** screen.

10. In the attribute mapping table row containing `emails[type eq "work"].value` and `mail`, select **Edit** to go to the **Edit Attribute** screen and configure the following parameters:
    * Set **Match objects using this attribute** to **Yes**.
    * Set **Matching precedence** to **2**.
11. Select **OK** to save the configuration. This closes the **Edit Attribute** screen. Then, on the **Attribute Mapping** screen, select **Save**.

## Testing

1. On the Enterprise application overview screen, go to **Manage > Provisioning > Provision on Demand** to test the SCIM connection.
2. Go to **Select a user or group** and enter the name of a user that you assigned to the application, then select the user and choose **Provision**. This creates the user in the Auth0 tenant.
3. Set the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in order to [provision all assigned users](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/configure-automatic-user-provisioning-portal#provisioning-status).
