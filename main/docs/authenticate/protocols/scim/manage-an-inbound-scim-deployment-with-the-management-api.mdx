To learn more about the supported SCIM management operations and how to use them, go to the [Auth0 Management API Explorer](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) and expand the **Connections** tab. The <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=management+API">management API</Tooltip> can enable, update, and remove the SCIM configuration for a selected connection, as well as create and delete SCIM tokens.

### Register a client app for management API communication

To use the Auth0 management API, register a machine-to-machine client application that has the permissions necessary to manage your SCIM configuration.

1. From the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), select **Applications**.
2. Select **Create Application**.
3. Enter a name, select **Machine to Machine App**, and select **Create**.
4. On your new app, select the **APIs** tab, and set **Auth0 Management API** to **Authorized**.
5. Under **Permissions**, select `read:scim_config`, `create:scim_config`, `update:scim_config`, `delete:scim_config`, `create:scim_token`, `read:scim_token`, and `delete:scim_token.`
6. Select **Update**.
7. Follow the instructions in [Management API Access Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens) to learn how to get tokens and call the [Auth0 Management API v2](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/post-scim-configuration) endpoints.
