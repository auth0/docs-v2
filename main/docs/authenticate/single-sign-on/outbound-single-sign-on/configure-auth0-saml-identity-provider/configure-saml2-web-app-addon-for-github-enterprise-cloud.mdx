You can configure Auth0 to serve as an <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> for [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) (github.com). GitHub requires an enterprise-level subscription to enable using an external <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=SAML">SAML</Tooltip> IdP.

* To learn about <Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=SSO">SSO</Tooltip> on GitHub, read [About authentication with SAML single sign-on](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) on https://docs.github.com.
* To learn how to configure Auth0 as the identity provider for GitHub Enterprise Server (private instance), read [Configure Auth0 as Identity Provider for GitHub Enterprise Server](/docs/authenticate/single-sign-on/outbound-single-sign-on/configure-auth0-saml-identity-provider/configure-saml2-web-app-addon-for-github-enterprise-server).

## Configure SAML SSO on Auth0

1. Go to [Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and create a new application. Give it a meaningful name like **GitHub**. You can choose any application type, but the **Regular Web App** type is recommended.
2. Go to the [Addons](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/addons) tab and enable the **SAML2 Web App** toggle.
3. On the **Settings** tab, set the **Application Callback URL** to: `https://github.com/orgs/{YOUR_GITHUB_ORG_NAME}/saml/consume`.

4. Paste the following code into the **Settings** text box and click **Debug**.

   ```json lines
   {
         "audience": "https://github.com/orgs/{yourGitHubOrgName}",
         "mappings": {
       "user_id": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier",
       "email": "emails",
       "name": "full_name"
         },
         "passthroughClaimsWithNoMapping": false,
         "mapIdentities": false,
         "signatureAlgorithm": "rsa-sha256",
         "digestAlgorithm": "sha256",
         "nameIdentifierProbes": [
       "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier"
         ]
       }
   ```


   

   

   1. Replace `{YOUR_GITHUB_ORG_NAME}` with the GitHub organization name that corresponds to your subscription. The mapping will send the `user_id` as the **Name Identifier** to GitHub. This is a good option if you enable more than one connection for the GitHub application, as it will ensure uniqueness (every user will have a different ID).
   2. If you are using a single connection, you might want to use the `nickname` or another unique identifier as a friendlier **Name Identifier** (but make sure that the property you choose is unique). As an example, if you want `nickname` as the **Name Identifier**, the `mappings` section above will look like this:
5. Scroll to the bottom of the tab and click **Enable**.
6. On the **Usage** tab, locate **Identity Provider Metadata** and click **Download** to download the metadata file. You will need this when you configure Auth0 as the identity provider.

## Configure SAML SSO on GitHub

1. Follow the instructions in GitHub for [Enabling and testing SAML Single Sign-on (SSO) for your organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-and-testing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization) to complete the configuration on GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
2. You will need the following information:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Entry</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sign On URL</td>
      <td>
        `https://{yourDomain}/samlp/{CLIENT_ID}`<br/>
        <code>{'{CLIENT_ID}'}</code> will be the <code>client_id</code> for the GitHub application you just created in Auth0.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Issuer</td>
      <td>`urn:auth0:{yourTenant}`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Public Certificate</td>
      <td>
        Download it from `https://{yourDomain}/pem`. Open the downloaded file with a text editor, copy the contents and paste it in the text area on GitHub.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Signature method</td>
      <td>`RSA256-SHA256`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Digest method</td>
      <td>`SHA256`</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

3. As recommended in GitHub's documentation, before enabling SAML SSO for your organization, click **Test SAML configuration** to ensure that the information you've entered is correct.

When setting up SAML single sign-on (SSO) for your organization, you can test your implementation without affecting your organization members by leaving **Require SAML SSO authentication** **for all members of the organization** unchecked.
