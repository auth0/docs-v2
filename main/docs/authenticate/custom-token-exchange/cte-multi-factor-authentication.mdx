<Warning>

Custom Token Exchange is currently available in Early Access for all Auth0 Enterprise and B2B Pro customers. By using this feature, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in [Okta’s Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/legal/). To learn more about Auth0’s product release cycle, read [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages). To learn more about subscription types, review the Auth0 [pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing) page.

</Warning>

To add protection against token theft or other security risks, you can add Multi-factor Authentication to a Custom Token Exchange request using one of the following methods:

* [Enable and configure your MFA policy ](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/enable-mfa) for your tenant
* Use `api.multifactor.enable()`in a Post-Login Action

When you add MFA, the Auth0 Authorization Server rejects the initial Custom Token Exchange call to the `/token` endpoint with a `mfa_required` error. You can use the error in the [Auth0 MFA API](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-developer-resources/mfa-api) to challenge and verify a factor to obtain the requested Auth0 access, ID, and refresh tokens.

Custom Token Exchange Early Access does not support `api.authentication.challengeWith()` or `api.authentication.enrollWith()`. If you use those methods with your Post-Login Action, the transaction will fail with a non-recoverable error. Make sure you don't use those methods when `event.transaction.protocol==oauth2-token-exchange` depending on the `subject_token_type` value.

</Callout>

When a Custom Token Exchange transaction is associated with an Organization, `api.multifactor.enable()` and MFA policies are also not supported.

To learn more about how to use the MFA grant, read [Authenticate Using the Resource Owner Password Flow with MFA](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/authenticate-using-ropg-flow-with-mfa), as Custom Token Exchange follows the same model. You can also check out a detailed example in [Use case: Perform MFA during Custom Token Exchange](/docs/authenticate/custom-token-exchange/cte-example-use-cases#use-case%3A-perform-mfa-during-custom-token-exchange).
