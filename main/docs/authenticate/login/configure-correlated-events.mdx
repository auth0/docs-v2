<Warning>
Correlated events is currently in Limited Early Access. By using this feature, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/legal). To learn more about Auth0's product release cycle, read [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages). To participate in this program, contact [Auth0 Support](support.auth0.com) or your Technical Account Manager.
</Warning>

Auth0 provides the capability to trace authentication transactions with Correlated Events. This tracking capability can reduce support response time and provide you with multi-system tracking downstream of authentication events. 

The `correlation_id` parameter adds a unique identifier generated by your application to the authorization URL. This ID is automatically recorded, allowing you to track and filter events in [Auth0 Tenant Logs](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs).

Correlation ID persists through the following events:
*  Signup
*  Login
*  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enrollment and challenges
*  Password reset

You can use Correlated Events with Universal Login, Universal Login Page Templates, Flows, and Auth0 Actions.

## Configure correlation ID

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
Values for `correlation_id` should be strings no longer than 64 characters and **should not** contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
</Callout>

Pass the `correlation_id` parameter in the `authorizationParams` object to append the unique ID to the authorization URL, similar to the following example:

```JavaScript
const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();
loginWithRedirect({
  authorizationParams: {
    // Appends "&correlation_id=..." to the URL for tracking
    correlation_id: "txn_12345_xyz" 
  }
});
```

## Universal Login

All Universal Login flows support `correlation_id`. Once you pass the correlation ID value to the `/authorize` endpoint, authentication events generate tenant logs with the correlation ID you can use for tracking. Use the Management API SDK to retrieve and filter recent events to isolate a specific transaction.

**Example** <br></br>
The following sample call uses the Management API SDK to retrieve the latest authentication events. Then, it filters locally to isolate a specific event:

```javascript
// 1. Call the Management API (SDK v5 syntax)
const { data: logs } = await management.logs.list({ 
  per_page: 100, 
  sort: 'date:-1' 
});
// 2. Filter the array client-side to find your ID
const transactionEvents = logs.filter(log =>
  log.references?.correlation_id === "txn_12345_xyz"
);
console.log(`Found ${transactionEvents.length} events for this transaction.`);
```

### Login Page Template
If you customize your login experience with [Universal Login Page Templates](/docs/customize/login-pages/universal-login/customize-templates), add the `correlation_id` to your template to track authentication events with custom login.

**Example**<br></br>
The following sample demonstrates `correlationId: "{{correlation_id}}"` added to the `{%- auth0:widget -%}`.

```html
<!-- Example: Injecting the ID into a client-side script -->
<script>
  window.addEventListener("load", function () {
    const loginContext = {
      application: "{{application.name}}",
      // Access the correlation_id directly via Liquid syntax
      correlationId: "{{correlation_id}}"
    };

    console.log("Tracking Context:", loginContext);
    // You can now pass loginContext.correlationId to your analytics tool
  });
</script>
```

## Auth0 Actions

With Auth0 Actions [Signup and Login Triggers](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers), use the `event` object to log events to third-party services or pass the events to downstream APIs.

The following event objects support `correlation_id`:

* [Pre-user-registration](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/pre-user-registration-trigger/pre-user-registration-event-object)
* [Post-user-registration](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/post-user-registration-trigger/post-user-registration-event-object)
* [Post-login](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-event-object)
* [Post-challenge](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/password-reset-triggers/post-challenge-trigger/post-challenge-event-object)

**Example**<br></br>
The sample Post-Login Action demonstrates how to extract the `correlation_id` from the `event` object.
```javascript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  console.log('PostLogin Action Start');
  const correlation_id = event.transaction?.correlation_id;
  // Check if correlation_id exists
  if (correlation_id) {
    console.log(`Correlation ID found: ${correlation_id}`);
  } else {
    console.log('No correlation_id found in transaction');
  }
  console.log('PostLogin Action End');
};
```
## Forms

You can use Correlated Events in Forms and Flows. Forms allows you to customize signup and login with custom logic you create in Flows. To use Correlated Events in Forms and Flows, use the `context` object in the Flows editor to add the correlated events variable, `{{context.transaction.correlation_id}}`, to your logic. To learn more, read [Variables and helper functions](/docs/customize/forms/variables).
