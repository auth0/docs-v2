Auth0 provides the capability to trace authentication transactions with Correlated Events. This tracking capability can reduce support response time and provide you with multi-system tracking downstream of authentication events. 

The `correlation_id` parameter adds a unique identifier generated by your application to the authorization URL. When authentication events occur, track and filter events in [Auth0 Tenant Logs](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs).

Correlation ID persists through the following events:
*  Signup
*  Login
*  Multi-Factor Authentication enrollment
*  Password reset

Correlated Events is supported with Auth0 Universal Login, Universal Login Page Templates, Flows, and Auth0 Actions.

## Configure correlation ID

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
Values for `correlation_id` should be strings no longer than 64 characters and **do not** contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
</Callout>

Pass the `correlation_id` parameter in the `authorizationParams` object to appends the unique ID to the authorization URL similar to the following example:

```JavaScript
const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();
loginWithRedirect({
  authorizationParams: {
    // Appends "&correlation_id=..." to the URL for tracking
    correlation_id: "txn_12345_xyz" 
  }
});
```

## Universal Login

All Universal Login flows support `correlation_id`.

## Auth0 Actions

Use the `correlation_id` parameter with Auth0 Actions Signup and Login Triggers. The `event.transaction` object for the following triggers:

* [Pre-user-registration](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/pre-user-registration-trigger/pre-user-registration-event-object)
* [Post-user-registration](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/post-user-registration-trigger/post-user-registration-event-object)
* [Post-login](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-event-object)
* [Post-challenge](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/password-reset-triggers/post-challenge-trigger/post-challenge-event-object)

Correlation IDs can be up to 64 characters and leveraged at the root level of [Auth0 Tenant Logs](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs).

To use correlation_id with Management API, set the `correlation_id`in the X-Correlation-ID header of your Management API calls:
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhb..." -H "x-correlation-id: client1_xyz" https://@@TENANT@@/api/v2/users
```
