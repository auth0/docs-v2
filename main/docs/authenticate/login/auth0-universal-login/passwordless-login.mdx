<Tooltip tip="Universal Login: Your application redirects to Universal Login, hosted on Auth0's Authorization Server, to verify a user's identity." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Universal+Login">Universal Login</Tooltip> is Auth0's implementation of the authentication flow, which is the key feature of an <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a userâ€™s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Authorization+Server">Authorization Server</Tooltip>. Each time a user needs to prove their identity, your applications redirect to Universal Login and Auth0 guarantees the user's identity. You can choose to enable <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> authentication when you configure Universal Login in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>.

First, determine if you want users to use SMS, email, or WebAuthn for device biometrics as the Passwordless authentication method. It is not currently possible to support all three authentication methods in a single login flow.

## Passwordless with email or SMS

You can configure Auth0 so users can authenticate with a magic link or one-time password (OTP) sent to their email, or an OTP sent to their phone number. To learn more, read [Configure Email or SMS for Passwordless Authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/passwordless-login/email-or-sms).

## Passwordless with WebAuthn with device biometrics

When using WebAuthn with Device Biometrics, users will be able to authenticate with their password, or with any of their devices that support WebAuthn with Device Biometrics.

Each time they login from a new device, Auth0 will offer them the option to use biometrics instead of a password. To learn more, read [Passwordless with WebAuthn with Device Biometrics](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/passwordless-login/webauthn-device-biometrics).
