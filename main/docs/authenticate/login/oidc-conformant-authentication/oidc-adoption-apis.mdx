With the OIDC-conformant pipeline, you should define applications and APIs (resources) as separate Auth0 entities. Benefits include:

* Simpler API integration: APIs are no longer tied to applications that call them.
* [Machine-to-machine (M2M)](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow) integration scenarios: Applications can authenticate as themselves (instead of acting on behalf of a user) to programmatically and securely get an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip>.

## Architecture

Suggested OIDC-conformant solutions for different scenarios include:

* **Multiple applications calling an API under a single <Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+ID">client ID</Tooltip>**: Represent each application with a single Auth0 application, each of which can interact with the API on which the applications depend.
* **Exchange tokens obtained by one application for tokens for a different application with delegation**: Use a multi-application solution, with each application authenticating to the same <Tooltip tip="Resource Server: Server hosting protected resources. Resource servers accept and respond to protected resource requests." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=resource+server">resource server</Tooltip>.
* **Applications do not depend on external APIs; only used to authenticate users**: You do not need to define an API as long as <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+tokens">ID tokens</Tooltip> are:

  + Processed only by the application.
  + Not sent to any external services.
