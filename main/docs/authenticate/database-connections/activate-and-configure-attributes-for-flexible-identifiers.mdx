<Warning>

Enabling Flexible Identifiers on your tenant has the potential to introduce breaking changes to your production environment. For more information on potential problems and limitations, see [Flexible Identifiers and Attributes](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/flexible-identifiers-and-attributes).

</Warning>

## Activate attributes configuration

1. Navigate to [**Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Database**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database), then select the Database Connection you’d like to activate from the list of **Database Connections**.
2. Go to the **Attributes** tab and choose **Activate** on the **New Attributes Configuration** screen, then confirm you’ve tested your configuration in a Development environment.
3. Select **Proceed**. The new configuration options become available.

### Choose Attributes on a new connection

Attributes are added to connections by navigating to [**Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Database**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database).

To create a new connection, choose **+ Create DB Connection** and pick which Attributes to add. To add, configure, or remove Attributes in use by an existing connection, configure an existing connection, choose the **Attributes** tab and follow the instructions below.

Default values are assigned to a new connection and can be edited after the connection has been created.

### Configure or remove existing Attributes on a connection

All Attributes can be changed or deleted from your <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>. Users cannot log in, sign up or reset passwords using the removed Attribute, and a minimum of one Attribute must remain active on every connection.

To change or remove an Attribute, navigate to the Attributes tab, then choose the **...** menu button next to an Attribute and select **Configure** or **Remove** from the dropdown menu.

### Revert a connection

To revert a connection back to its original state, use the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> [Update a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-connections-by-id) endpoint with an `options` object that does not include the `attributes` parameter, as shown below.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

* If you use the `options` parameter, the entire `options` object is overridden. To avoid partial data or other issues, ensure all current parameters are present by copying the contents within the connections `options` object and including it in the PATCH call. The only parameter you should remove is `attributes`.
* If your tenant has `username` enabled as an Attribute, performing the following action requires you to modify your `username` settings. You'll need to reconfigure your username settings if you choose this path.

```json lines
{
"options": {
       }
}
