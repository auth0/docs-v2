title: Custom Database Connections
---
Use a custom database connection when you want to provide Auth0 with access to your own independent (legacy) identity data store primarily for authentication (filling the role of an <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip>) and for migrating user data to Auth0's data store.

Auth0 [Extensibility](/docs/customize/extensions) allows you to add custom logic to build out last-mile solutions for Identity and Access Management (IdAM). Auth0 provides extensibility through [Actions](/docs/customize/actions) and [scripts](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/templates) for both custom database connections and custom database migration. Each is implemented using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) running on the Auth0 platform in an Auth0 tenant.

Auth0 extensibility executes at different points in the IdAM pipeline:

* **Actions** are secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js that execute at certain points within the Auth0 platform. Actions are used to customize and extend Auth0’s capabilities with custom logic. For more information, read [Understand how Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

* **Custom database action scripts** can be used to integrate with an existing user identity store, or can be used where [automatic user migration](/docs/manage-users/user-migration) from a legacy identity store is required. Various [templates](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/templates) are provided.

Whatever the use case, Auth0 extensibility allows you to tailor IdAM operations to your exact requirements. However, if not used in the right way, this can open up the potential for improper or unintended use which can lead to problematic situations down the line. In an attempt to address matters ahead of time, Auth0 provides [best practice guidance](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/custom-database-connections-scripts) to both designers and implementers, and we recommend reading it in its entirety at least once, even if you've already started your journey with Auth0.
