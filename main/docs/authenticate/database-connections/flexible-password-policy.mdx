description: Use the Flexible Password Policy to define password strength and composition rules for database connections in Auth0.
---

The Flexible Password Policy replaces the [legacy password policies](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/password-options) to provide increased granularity and configuration options.

| Policy | Legacy Behavior | Flexible Password Policy Behavior |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Password strength | Choose from five preset levels of complexity.<br/><br/>Silently truncates passwords beyond maximum length. | Customize all complexity requirements independently.<br/><br/>Choose behavior for passwords beyond maximum length (truncate or error). |
| Password history | Configure the number of previous passwords that a user cannot reuse, up to 24. | Retains equivalent functionality. |
| Password dictionary | Uses one built-in dictionary of 10,000 common words. | Choose between two built-in dictionaries of 10,000 or 100,000 common words. |
| Block personal data | Blocks a fixed set of user data fields. | Fully customize which fields to block. |

In the configuration schema for database connections, the Flexible Password Policy also replaces the legacy password policy `options` objects and values (`passwordPolicy`, `password_complexity_options`, `password_history`, `password_no_personal_info`, `password_dictionary`) with a single, configurable `password_options` object.

The Flexible Password Policy is currently in [Early Access](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).
</Callout>

* During Early Access, the Flexible Password Policy configuration is only available using the Management API and is not available in the Auth0 Dashboard.

* When you enable the Flexible Password Policy:

    * Legacy password policy configuration in your database connection's `options` is ignored.

    * Legacy password policy configuration in the Auth0 Dashboard becomes read-only.

## Enable the Flexible Password Policy

To enable the Flexible Password Policy, you need to update your database connection's `options` object to include the new `password_options` object.

### Prerequisites

The following requirements are necessary to use the Flexible Password Policy:

* You must use a database connection with the Auth0 user store (`"strategy": "auth0"`).

* The tenant must use Universal Login.

* The tenant must not have a custom password reset screen configured.

* Your Management API access token must have the `read:connections` and `update:connections` scopes. Without them, you cannot retrieve or modify the database connection's configuration, respectively.

### 1. Compose the new configuration

First, get your database connection's current configuration using the [Get a connection endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections-by-id). You can view the full response schema in the API reference.

In the `options` object, append a new `password_options` object. Do not remove or modify the rest of the `options` object to preserve your database connection's overall configuration.

For example, the following `password_options` object enforces passwords with a minimum length of 15 characters and one each of an uppercase character, a lowercase character, a number, and a special character, and additionally prevents users from reusing their most recent five passwords:

```json
"password_options": {
    "complexity": {
        "min_length": 15,
        "character_types": ["uppercase", "lowercase", "number", "special"],
        "character_type_rule": "all"
    },
    "history": {
        "active": true,
        "size": 5
    }
}
```

### 2. Update the database connection

Update your database connection with the new `options` object using the [Update a connection endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-connections-by-id).

This endpoint overwrites the entire `options` object with the new `options` object you provide, so include the entirety of the original `options` object with the additional `password_options` object appended.

You can verify the update by getting your database connection's configuration with the [Get a connection endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/post-connections) again. If the response contains the `password_options` object, the Flexible Password Policy is enabled for that database connection.

### Revert to the legacy password policies

To revert back to the legacy password policies, follow the same process to update the database connection with its original `options`, removing the entire `password_options` object.
