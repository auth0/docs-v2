You can configure a <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> connection to send a Magic Link to a user through email to complete authentication.

To learn more, read [Configure Email or SMS for Passwordless Authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/passwordless-login/email-or-sms).

## How it works

When a user opens a Magic Link, Auth0 logs them in directly. It is similar in function to them receiving an email with a one-time password (OTP), returning to your application, and entering the OTP, but without having to actually perform those steps.

### Limitations

Magic Links are not supported for <Tooltip tip="Universal Login: Your application redirects to Universal Login, hosted on Auth0's Authorization Server, to verify a user's identity." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Universal+Login">Universal Login</Tooltip>.

When using Magic Links with Classic Login, both the initial request and its response must take place in the same browser or the transaction will fail. This is particularly relevant for iOS users, who cannot change their default web browser.

For example, the user might make the initial request using the Chrome browser, but when the user opens the Magic Link in their email, iOS automatically opens it in Safari (the default browser). If this happens, the transaction will fail.

### Classic Login flow with Magic Links

The user then clicks the button or link in the email and is automatically signed in to your application.

## Configure the connection

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to [Authentication > Passwordless](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/passwordless), and then enable the **Email** toggle.
2. Select **Email** to open the configuration window, switch to the **Settings** view, and enter your email's **From**, **Subject**, and **Message** text.

   <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

   You must change the **From** value to an email address that does not use the `auth0.com` domain for Auth0 to send your custom email templates. If you do not, Auth0 sends the default email template.

   </Callout>
3. Enter any **Authentication Parameters** you would like to include in the generated sign-in link.
4. Decide if you want to **Disable Sign Ups**. If you enable this setting, you can allow passwordless access for only existing users, but may expose your application to the threat of user enumeration attacks. To learn more, read [Passwordless Connections Best Practices](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/best-practices).
5. Select **Save**.

### Multi-language support

The **Message** area supports multiple languages.

To specify a language, call the [Auth0 Authentication API Get Code or Link endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-code-or-link) and set the value of the `x-request-language` header. When this header is not set, the language is extracted from the `accept-language` header, which is automatically set by the browser.

### Message syntax

The **Message** area accepts Liquid syntax. You can use this syntax, combined with parameter values, to programmatically construct elements of the message.

For example, you can reference the `request_language` parameter to change the language of the message:

```liquid lines
{% if request_language contains 'dutch' %}
   Hier is uw verificatie code: {{ code }}
{% endif %}
{% if request_language contains 'fr-FR' %}
   Ceci est votre code: {{ code }}
{% endif %}
```






The following parameters are available when defining the message template:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Parameter</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>code</code></td>
<td>The password to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>link</code></td>
<td>The generated sign-in link.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>application.name</code></td>
<td>The name of the application with which the user is signing up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>request_language</code></td>
<td>The requested language for message content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>operation</code></td>
<td>Indicates when the template has been triggered by an update to a user's email through the API. When triggered, the value is <code>change_email</code>, otherwise it is <code>null</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Update Classic Login settings

If you are using Classic Login for your application, you must update the page template to implement Magic Links.

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to [**Branding > Universal Login > Advanced Options**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/login_settings).
2. Switch to the **Login** view, locate the **Default Templates** dropdown, and select **Lock (passwordless).**
3. Next, update the `Auth0LockPasswordless` section of code with a new parameter. Add the `passwordlessMethod` to your template.

   ```bash lines
   passwordlessMethod: 'link',
   ```


   

   
4. Select **Save**.

To learn more about embedded login configuration options, read [Passwordless Authentication with Embedded Login](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/implement-login/embedded-login).

## Enable applications

Switch to the **Applications** view, and enable the applications for which you would like to use Passwordless Email.

## Email providers

Auth0 sends emails from its own SMTP provider by default. Auth0's built-in email provider is designed solely for testing purposes and does not support customization of email templates.

[Configure your own SMTP email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers) to manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications, and customize email templates.

Auth0 supports the following email providers:

* [Mandrill](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-mandrill-as-external-smtp-email-provider)
* [Amazon SES](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-amazon-ses-as-external-smtp-email-provider)
* [SendGrid](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-sendgrid-as-external-smtp-email-provider)
* [SparkPost](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-sparkpost-as-external-smtp-email-provider)
* [Mailgun](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-mailgun-as-external-smtp-email-provider)
* [Custom SMTP external email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-custom-external-smtp-email-provider)
