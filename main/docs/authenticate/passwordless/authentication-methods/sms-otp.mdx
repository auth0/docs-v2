You can configure <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> authentication to send a one-time password (OTP) to a user through SMS. To learn more, read [Configure Email or SMS for Passwordless Authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/passwordless-login/email-or-sms).

Auth0 supports using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) and a custom phone provider to send OTPs. If you would like to use a custom phone provider with Auth0 Actions, read [Configure a Custom Phone Provider](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider) or [Configure a Custom Phone Provider with Terraform](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider/configure-a-custom-phone-provider-with-terraform).

## How it works

When a new user receives a code and enters it for the first time in your application, their user profile is created on the `sms` connection before being authenticated by Auth0.

If the phone number that the OTP was sent to matches an existing user, Auth0 authenticates the user:

### Universal Login

## Configure the phone provider

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to [Branding > Phone Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/phone/templates/phone/provider).
2. Enable the Phone Message Provider toggle.

3. Select your phone message provider.

   1. To use Twilio, follow [Configure Twilio as a Phone Messaging Provider](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-twilio-as-a-phone-messaging-provider).
   2. To use a custom provider, follow [Configure a Custom Phone Provider](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider) to use Auth0 Actions.
4. Select your delivery method.
5. **Save** your changes.

## Legacy SMS gateway

If Auth0 Action's custom phone provider cannot support your use case, you can manage the custom SMS gateway on [passwordless SMS connections](/docs/authenticate/passwordless) with <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>. To learn more, read [Set Up Custom SMS Gateway for Passwordless Connections](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/use-sms-gateway-passwordless).

### Configure Passwordless SMS settings

1. In **Message**, enter the body text of the SMS.

   <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

   The `@@password@@` placeholder will automatically be replaced with the one-time password that is sent to the user.

   </Callout>
2. Adjust settings for your **OTP Expiry** and **OTP Length**.

   * Only the last one-time password (or link) issued will be accepted. Once the latest one is issued, any others are invalidated. Once used, the latest one is also invalidated.
   * Only three failed attempts to input the one-time password are allowed. After this, a new code will need to be requested.
   * The one-time password issued will be valid (by default) for three minutes before it expires.
   * If you choose to extend the amount of time it takes for your one-time password to expire, you should also extend the length of the one-time password code. Otherwise, an attacker has a larger window of time to attempt to guess a short code.
3. Decide if you want to **Disable Sign Ups**. If you enable this setting, you can allow passwordless access for only existing users, but may expose your application to the threat of user enumeration attacks. To learn more, read [Passwordless Connections Best Practices](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/best-practices).
4. Select **Save**.

#### Multi-language support

The **Message** area supports multiple languages.

To specify a language, call the [Auth0 Authentication API Get Code or Link endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-code-or-link) and set the value of the `x-request-language` header. When this header is not set, the language is extracted from the `accept-language` header, which is automatically set by the browser.

#### Message syntax

The **Message** area accepts Liquid syntax. You can use this syntax, combined with parameter values, to programmatically construct elements of the message.

For example, you can reference the `request_language` parameter to change the language of the message:

```liquid lines
{% if request_language contains 'dutch' %}
   Hier is uw verificatie code: {{ password }}
{% endif %}
{% if request_language contains 'fr-FR' %}
   Ceci est votre code: {{ password }}
{% endif %}
```






The following parameters are available when defining the message template:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Parameter</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>password</code> or <code>code</code></td>
<td>The password to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>phone_number</code></td>
<td>The user's phone number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>application.name</code></td>
<td>The name of the application with which the user is signing up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>request_language</code></td>
<td>The requested language for message content.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
