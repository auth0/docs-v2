<td><a href="/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/email-otp">Email</a></td>
<td>The user is asked to enter their email address, to which Auth0 sends a one-time-use code. The user enters the code into your application.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/email-magic-link">Magic Link</a></td>
<td>The user is asked to enter their email address, to which Auth0 sends an email with a link in it. The user clicks the link and is directly logged in to your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/sms-otp">SMS</a></td>
<td>The user is asked to enter their phone number, to which Auth0 sends a one-time-use code. By default, Auth0 uses Twilio to send the code, but if you have a custom SMS gateway, you can modify your connection to use that instead.</td>
