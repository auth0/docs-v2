</Card>

The <Tooltip tip="Universal Login: Your application redirects to Universal Login, hosted on Auth0's Authorization Server, to verify a user's identity." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Universal+Login">Universal Login</Tooltip> Experience supports [Passwordless connections](/docs/authenticate/passwordless), which allow users to provide a phone number or email address, and then receive a one-time password (OTP) to complete authentication.

## Enable Passwordless for Universal Login

To configure Universal Login to support <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> connections, you'll need to set the Authentication Profile to use a supported login flow, and update your application to specify the connection during authentication.

### Enable Identifier First

In the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>, go to [Authentication > Authentication Profile.](https://manage.auth0.com/?/authentication-profiles)

Select either **Identifier First** or **Identifier First + Biometrics**.

### Update your application

Depending on the type of connections you have enabled for your application, you may need to update your application to specify a Passwordless connection during login:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Database connection</strong></th>
<th><strong>Passwordless connection</strong></th>
<th><strong>Need to specify?</strong></th>
<th><strong>User experience</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>SMS and/or Email</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Specified Passwordless connection is presented during login.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No</td>
<td>SMS and Email</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Passwordless connection that was created first is presented.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No</td>
<td>SMS or Email</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Passwordless connection is presented (along with any enabled Social connections) during login.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To specify a Passwordless connection during login, you must pass the `connection` parameter and its value (either `sms` or `email`) to the [Auth0 Authentication API Login endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#login):

`https://mytenant.us.auth0.com/authorize?client_id={id}&``connection={sms|email}``&scope=…&response_type=code&response_mode=query&state=…&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000&code_challenge=…`

If you are using one of our SDKs, you can specify a Passwordless connection during initialization. For example:

```js lines
auth0 = await createAuth0Client({
     domain: config.domain,
     client_id: config.clientId,
     connection: "email"
  });

auth0 = await createAuth0Client({
     domain: config.domain,
     client_id: config.clientId,
     connection: "sms"
  });
```






<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If you are using Passwordless with Universal Login and [Single Sign-On](/docs/authenticate/single-sign-on), connection parameters `sms` and `email` do not utilize the existing Auth0 session, and the user will be prompted to log in.

</Callout>

### Test the connection

When the user is prompted to enter their OTP, they'll see one of the following screens:
