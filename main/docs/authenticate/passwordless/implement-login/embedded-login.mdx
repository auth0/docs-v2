If you'd like to embed the login user interface in your application, you can do it by using our [Embedded Passwordless API](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/implement-login/embedded-login/relevant-api-endpoints) or our SDKs.

Depending on the kind of application you want to build, you'll need to implement it differently:

* For Single Page Applications (SPAs) (for example, Angular or React), read [Embedded Passwordless Authentication for Single-page Applications (SPA)](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/implement-login/embedded-login/spa).
* For Native applications (for example, iOS, Android, or desktop applications), read [Embedded Passwordless Login in Native Applications](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/implement-login/embedded-login/native).
* For Regular Web Applications (for example, NodeJS, Java, Rails, or .NET), read [Embedded Passwordless Login in Regular Web Applications](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/implement-login/embedded-login/webapps).

Embedded login in regular web applications and SPAs require configuration of cross-origin authentication. To learn more, read [Cross-Origin Authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/cross-origin-authentication).
