<Warning>

Embedded login for web applications uses [cross-origin authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/cross-origin-authentication) unless you [configure a custom domain](/docs/customize/custom-domains) for your tenant. Cross-origin authentication uses third-party cookies to allow for secure authentication transactions across different origins.

</Warning>

## Using Auth0's SDKs to implement Embedded Login

You can implement <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> Login using Auth0's Lock widget, or if you need complete control of the user experience, you can implement it using Auth0.js:

* [Lock for Web](/docs/libraries/lock)
* [Auth0.js v9 Reference](/docs/libraries/auth0js)

### Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

For security purposes, your app's origin URL must be listed as an approved URL. If you have not already added it to the **Allowed Callback URLS** for your application, you will need to add it to the list of **Allowed Origins (CORS)**.

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications), and select the name of your application to see its settings.
2. Locate **Allowed Origins (CORS)**, enter your application's [origin URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin), and select **Save Changes**.

## Customize MFA

<Warning>
Customizable MFA with the Resource Owner Password Grant, Embedded, or Refresh Token flows is in Early Access. To learn more, read [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages). To participate in the early access, contact [Auth0 Support](https://support.auth0.com/).
</Warning>

Customize <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> with embedded flows. Use the MFA API to allow users to enroll and challenge with factors of their choice that are supported by your application.



When using [Lock for Web](/docs/libraries/lock#2-authenticating-and-getting-user-info), the `oauth/token` endpoint returns the `mfa_required` error and includes the `mfa_token` you need to use the MFA API and `mfa_requirements` parameter with a list of authenticators your application currently supports:

```json lines
{
  "error": "mfa_required",
  "error_description": "Multifactor authentication required",
  "mfa_token": "Fe26...Ha",
  "mfa_requirements": {
    "challenge": [
      { "type": "otp" },
      { "type": "push-notification" },
      { "type": "phone" },
      { "type": "recovery-code" }
      { "type": "email"} //can only work with challenge
    ]
  }
}
```



Use the `mfa_token` to call the [`mfa/authenticator`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/muti-factor-authentication/list-authenticators) endpoint to list all factors the user has enrolled and match the same `type` your application supports. You also need to obtain the matching `authenticator_type` to issue challenges:

```json lines
[
  {
    "type": "recovery-code",
    "id": "recovery-code|dev_qpOkGUOxBpw6R16t",
    "authenticator_type": "recovery-code",
    "active": true
  },
  {
    "type": "otp",
    "id": "totp|dev_6NWz8awwC8brh2dN",
    "authenticator_type": "otp",
    "active": true
  }
]
```

Proceed to enforce the MFA challenge by calling the [`request/mfa/challenge`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication/muti-factor-authentication/request-mfa-challenge) endpoint.

Further customize your MFA flow with Auth0 Actions. To learn more, read [Actions Triggers: post-challenge - API Object](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/password-reset-triggers/post-challenge-trigger/post-challenge-api-object).
