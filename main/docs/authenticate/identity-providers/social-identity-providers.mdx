Auth0 supports social login for both web-based and native applications. Social login is a method of authentication that allows users to log in to an application using existing credentials from a social <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip>, such as Google or Facebook.

As users frequently have their social credentials stored in their browser or device, social login provides a frictionless user experience that requires minimal manual interaction with an application.

The sections below outline the social login options available for both web-based and native applications.

## Web-based applications

Auth0 supports a variety of social identity providers for web-based applications. Implementing social login with one or more of these providers allows you to gather up-to-date information about your users while simultaneously offering them a streamlined authentication experience.

You can review the list of supported social identity providers on the [Auth0 Marketplace](https://marketplace.auth0.com/categories/social-login) or the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>. If a particular provider is not available, you can also configure custom social connections. To learn more, review [Connect Apps to Generic OAuth2 Authorization Servers](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/oauth2).

<Tabs><Tab title="Auth0 Marketplace">

The [Social Login](https://marketplace.auth0.com/categories/social-login) section of the Auth0 Marketplace provides information for each supported social connection. To learn more about a specific provider, select the option from the list.

From there, you can use the **Add Integration** button to launch the configuration process in your Auth0 tenant and the **Installation** tab to review implementation documentation. For a successful implementation, ensure you [register developer keys](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/devkeys) for your selected provider.

</Tab><Tab title="Auth0 Dashboard">

To implement social login from the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to [Authentication > Social](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social) and select **Create Connection**. Then, choose a connection option from the list of supported social identity providers.

After selecting an option from the list, the configuration process launches. Follow the prompts to configure your selected provider.

For assistance, select the **Setup Guide** button to the top right to open relevant implementation documentation in a popup. The setup guide contains information on the necessary steps to configure the connection and links to relevant documentation from the social identity provider.

For a successful implementation, ensure you [register developer keys](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/devkeys) for your selected provider.

You can also access the Auth0 Marketplace through the Auth0 Dashboard. Navigate to [Marketplace](https://manage.auth0.com/#/marketplace) on the main menu and choose the **Social Login** category. From there, you can review and implement connections with any of the available social identity providers.
