In addition to the WS-Federation and <Tooltip tip="OpenID: Open standard for authentication that allows applications to verify users' identities without collecting and storing login information." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OpenID">OpenID</Tooltip> Connect flows, it's also possible to use the [Resource Owner](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/resource-owner-password-flow) flow with Azure AD. This flow allows you to capture and validate a user's credentials (email and password) instead of showing the Azure AD login page. For security and <Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Single+Sign-on">Single Sign-on</Tooltip> (SSO) reasons, this is not the recommended approach; still, the <Tooltip tip="Resource Owner: Entity (such as a user or application) capable of granting access to a protected resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Resource+Owner">Resource Owner</Tooltip> flow can be useful in Native mobile scenarios or to batch-process authentication with Azure AD.

This configuration requires two applications: a Web Application and/or Web API, and a Native Application. From Azure AD's point of view, users will be authenticated using the Native Application to gain access to the Web Application and/or Web API.

## Prerequisites

[Register your Application with Auth0](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications):

1. Select **Native** for the **Application Type**.
2. Add an **Allowed Callback URL**. Your callback URL format will vary depending on your platform. For details about the format for your platform, see our [Native Quickstarts](/docs/quickstart/native).
3. Ensure your Application's [Grant Types](/docs/get-started/applications/update-grant-types) include the appropriate flows.

## Steps

To connect your application using Resource Owner flow, you must:

1. [Set up your applications in the Microsoft Azure portal](#set-up-your-applications-in-the-microsoft-azure-portal).
2. [Create an enterprise connection in Auth0](#create-an-enterprise-connection-in-auth0).
3. [Enable the enterprise connection for your Auth0 Application](#enable-the-enterprise-connection-for-your-auth0-application).
4. [Test the connection](#test-the-connection).

<Card title="Microsoft Azure account">

Before proceeding, you will need a valid Microsoft Azure account and must have **your own** Microsoft Azure AD directory for which you are a Global administrator.

If you don't have a Microsoft Azure account, you can [sign up for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free); then, if necessary, set up an Azure AD directory by following Microsoft's [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory - Create a new tenant for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-tenant-for-your-organization).

Alternatively, if you have an Office 365 account, you can use the account's Azure AD instance instead of creating a new one. To access your Office 365 account's Azure AD instance:

1. [Sign in to Office 365](https://portal.office.com), and navigate to the [Office 365 Admin Center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage).
2. Open the **Admin centers** menu drawer located in the left menu, and click on **Azure AD**.

</Card>

## Set up your applications in the Microsoft Azure portal

<Warning>

Before proceeding, you must have already set up **your own** Microsoft Azure AD directory for which you are a Global administrator. To learn how, follow Microsoft's [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory - Create a new tenant for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-tenant-for-your-organization).

</Warning>

### Register a new web application

To learn how to register your application with Azure AD, read [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

<Warning>

If you have more than one Azure AD directory, make sure you are in the correct directory when you register your app.

</Warning>

While setting up your application, make sure you use the following settings:

* If you want to allow users from external organizations (like other Azure AD directories), select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** when setting **Supported account types**.
* When asked to set a **Redirect URI**, select **Web** and enter your callback URL: `https://{yourDomain}/login/callback`.

<Card title="Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects">

If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our [custom domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains) feature, your domain name is a concatenation of your tenant name, your regional subdomain, and `auth0.com`, separated by the dot (`.`) symbol.

For example, if your tenant name is `exampleco-enterprises`, and your tenant is in the US region, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your **Redirect URI** would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`.

However, if your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020, then your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your **Redirect URI** would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains), your **Redirect URI** would be `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

</Card>

During this process, record the **Application (client) ID** that Microsoft generates for your application (you can find this on the application's **Overview** screen) as you will need it later in the tutorial.

### Configure your web application to expose an API

To learn how to configure your Web application to expose an API with Azure AD, read [Quickstart: Configure an application to expose web APIs on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis).

While configuring your app, make sure you use the following settings:

* When asked to set a **Scope name**, enter `API.Access`.

During this process, record the **Application ID URI** that Microsoft generates for your application as you will need it later in the tutorial.

### Register a new native application

To learn how to register a native application in Azure, read [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

<Warning>

If you have more than one Azure AD directory, make sure you are in the correct directory when you register your app.

</Warning>

While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:

* If you want to allow users from external organizations (like other Azure AD directories), select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** when setting **Supported account types**.
* When asked to set a **Redirect URI**, select `Public client/native (mobile & desktop)` and enter your callback URL. Your callback URL format will vary depending on your platform. For details about the format for your platform, read [Native Quickstarts](/docs/quickstart/native).

During this process, record the **Application (client) ID** that Microsoft generates for your application (you can find this on the application's **Overview** screen) as you will need it later in the tutorial.

### Create a client secret for your native application

To learn how to create a <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+secret">client secret</Tooltip>, read [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs - Add Credentials to your web application on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-credentials-to-your-web-application).

Generate a **Client secret** and record its value. You will need it later in the tutorial.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If you configure an expiring secret, make sure to **record the expiration date**; you will need to renew the key before that day to avoid a service interruption.

</Callout>

### Add permissions for your native application

To learn how to add permissions for your **Native** application, read [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs - Add permissions to access web APIs on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis).

Auth0 requires that you enable the least privileged permissions necessary (for the Microsoft Graph API and for the Web application you configured to expose an API) for this configuration to work properly. To learn more about Microsoft Graph API permissions, read [Microsoft Graph permissions reference on Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

While setting up your permissions, make sure you use the following settings for Microsoft Graph API:

* When asked for a permission type, choose **Delegated permissions**.

  + Under **User**, select **User.Read** so your app can sign in users and read the signed-in user's profile.
  + Under **Directory**, select **Directory.Read.All** so your app can read directory data on the signed-in user's behalf.

For your Web app that you configured to expose an API, make sure you use the following settings:

* When asked for a permission type, choose **Delegated permissions**.

  + Under **API**, select **API.Access** so your app can access your API on the user's behalf.

## Configure the connection in Auth0

After creating both applications in Azure AD, you can configure the Auth0 connection:

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Enterprise](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/enterprise), locate **Microsoft Azure AD**, and select the add (**+**) button.

   <Frame>![Dashboard - Connections - Enterprise](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/1fSTcrZpkgkPR64NnI1lr8/b3454e60a4463e99353603fd11a71983/Enterprise_Connections_-_EN.png)</Frame>
2. Enter details for your connection, and select **Create**:

<table class="table"><thead>

## Enable the enterprise connection for your Auth0 application

To use your new Azure AD enterprise connection, you must [enable the connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/enable-enterprise-connections) for your Auth0 Applications.

## Test the connection

Now you're ready to [test your connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/test-enterprise-connections).

## Group Memberships and Advanced Profile Information

In this native flow, Auth0 will receive an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip> from Azure AD which has been issued for your Azure AD Web application. As a result, features like loading group memberships and advanced profile information will no longer work because the Access Token received by Azure AD can no longer be used to query the Azure AD Graph API for this additional information.

However, if you depend on group memberships and advanced profile information, you can change your configuration to accommodate your needs:

1. In Azure, configure your Native application with additional permissions for the Microsoft Graph API:

   * When asked for a permission type, choose **Delegated permissions**.

     + Under **Directory**, select **Directory.AccessAsUser.All**, so your app can access the directory as the signed-in user.
2. In Auth0, modify your Azure AD enterprise connection:

   * In **Identity API**, select `Azure Active Directory (v1)`, and for **App ID URI**, enter the URI of the Azure AD Graph API:

     ```text lines
     https://graph.windows.net
     ```
