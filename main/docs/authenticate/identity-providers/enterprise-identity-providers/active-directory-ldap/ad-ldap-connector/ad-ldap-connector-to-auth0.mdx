You may need to point your AD/LDAP Connector instance to a new connection in Auth0, for example, If you have migrated to a new Auth0 tenant, or if you changed the name of the Auth0 connection. Because you can't rename connections in Auth0, you must create a new AD/ LDAP connection and point your existing Connector instances to it.

1. Create the new AD/LDAP connection in the Auth0 dashboard and copy the resulting **TICKET URL**. If you are using the custom domains, you will need to replace the `{yourDomain}` part of the **TICKET URL** with your custom domain, such as `identity.fabrikam.com`.
2. On the AD/LDAP Connector host in the Connector Admin app, perform an export of the existing settings via the **Import / Export** tab. This is just a precaution in case something were to happen in the following steps that would accidentally overwrite your custom settings. If you are running the Connector on a host that does not have a web browser to access to the Connector Admin website, simply make a copy of your `config.json` file.
3. On the AD/LDAP Connector host, edit the `config.json` file and change the value of the `PROVISIONING_TICKET` property to the **TICKET URL** you copied in Step 1.
4. If you moved from one Auth0 tenant to another, remove the property in the `config.json` file that has the name `urn:auth0:{oldAuth0TenantName}`. If this is not removed, the Connector will still function but this old configuration data is not needed.
5. Restart the AD/LDAP Connector service (the **Auth0 ADLDAP** service in Windows).
6. Take a look at the Connector logs (**Troubleshooting** tab in the Connector Admin tool or tail the `logs.log` file) and make sure there is a recent entry that looks something like: `2016-03-10T22:47:32.970Z - debug: [2016-03-10 22:47:32] Loading settings from ticket: {yourTicketUrl}/info`
7. Make sure the new AD/LDAP connection in the Auth0 dashboard is now showing as connected (the dot to the left of the new connection is green and not red).
8. Perform a test authentication through your new connection and make sure you see activity in your Connector logs as well.
