The [Okta Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/) is a collection of SaaS applications for which Okta provides an express setup experience for enabling single sign-in with OpenID Connect, automated user provisioning with SCIM, and [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview/). Okta administrators use the [Okta Admin Console] (https://www.okta.com/okta-administrator-experience/) to configure these integrations within their Okta tenant. 

Okta administrators use the Okta Admin Console to configure these integrations within their Okta tenant:

Express Configuration is a feature designed to automate the setup of single sign-on (SSO), SCIM-based user provisioning, and [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview/) for applications with minimal manual effort. It enables enterprise customers to securely configure identity integrations with SaaS applications without the need to copy and paste protocol-specific configuration values.

Express Configuration provides these benefits to Okta administrators and SaaS application developers:

* **Faster configurations**: This feature reduces the time required to set up an application instance by automating the exchange of configuration information between Okta and Auth0. It supports OIDC capabilities through a single control panel, significantly speeding up the overall configuration process for application integration instances.

* **Secure data handling**:  This approach utilizes OAuth 2.0 consent flows for the secure and authorized sharing of sensitive configuration data, thereby reducing potential errors related to credentials and configuration settings.

* **Reduce integration errors**:  Express Configuration simplifies and standardizes the integration deployment process. The automated workflow enables consistent and repeatable deployments of application integrations across multiple customers or environments, supporting a scalable application ecosystem with less opportunity for human error.

* **Better user experience**: Offers an intuitive and efficient configuration interface. The automation eliminates the complexity of manual setup, enabling Okta customer admins to quickly add instances of Auth0-enabled OIN integrations.

## How it works

Auth0 and Okta have introduced the Express Configuration API, which allows Auth0 applications published to the OIN to securely permit selected customers to express-configure an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) with OpenID Connect, SCIM, and Universal Logout within their Auth0 organization.

The diagram below illustrates an Express Configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN:

<Frame>![express configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN.](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-config-workflow.png)</Frame>

Steps:
1. An Okta administrator signs in to the Okta portal and selects the Express Configuration-enabled application from the OIN.
2. The Okta administrator navigates to the **Sign On** section and select **Express Configure SSO**. This redirects them to an [Auth0 Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/universal-login-vs-classic-login/universal-experience#universal-login-experience) screen.

3. The Okta administrator enters the credentials of an application user who is permitted to perform Express Configuration. In Auth0, this refers to a user who is a member of an [organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) and is authorized to perform Express Configuration using an [organizational role](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/add-member-roles) or other authorization method.

4. After authenticating, Auth0 prompts the Okta administrator for consent.

<Frame>![Auth0 consent](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-config-auth0-consent.png)</Frame>

5. After consenting, Okta uses the Express Configuration API to automatically configure an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) within the Auth0 organization to which the Okta administrator belongs.

6. The Okta administrator may then assign users to the application instance and see single sign-on working immediately.

Auth0 developers can also configure their OIN integration to allow Express Configuration of SCIM and Universal Logout, both of which are recommended:

* When SCIM is enabled, Okta administrators can configure SCIM by navigating to the **Provisioning** section of the application details and selecting **Express Configure SCIM**. 
* When Universal Logout is enabled, it will be automatically configured as part of the OpenID Connect integration.

To publish an application to the OIN with Express Configuration enabled, Auth0 must have the following:

* An [Okta Integrator Free Plan org](https://developer.okta.com/signup/), with access to either the Super Admin role or the App and Org Admin roles.
* An [Auth0 subscription](https://auth0.com/pricing) that enables the use of the Okta connection type and the Organizations feature for as many customers as you need.
* A SaaS application that has been integrated with Auth0 using a Multi-Organization Architecture.
    * This includes registering your application as a [Regular Web Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps) or [Single-Page Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps) in Auth0, and enabling each of your customers to sign into that application using their own distinct [identity providers](/docs/authenticate/enterprise-connections).
* An [Auth0 Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) is deployed, or can be deployed, for each customer using your SaaS application. Organizations and organizational roles are used to authorize specific users to perform express configuration and create Okta connections only within the organizations to which they belong.
<Note>
**Tip**: To view a sample application that implements a multi-tenant architecture including Auth0 Organizations and organizational roles, refer to the [SaaStart reference application](https://auth0.com/blog/speed-up-your-customer-identity-journey-with-auth0-saastart/).

## Configure you application for Express Configuration

The Auth0 Dashboard guides an Auth0 developer through enabling Express Configuration for their application and publishing it to the OIN.

An [Auth0 Admin role](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) in a production Auth0 tenant is required to complete the end-to-end setup and publishing process.
<Frame>![OIN in Auth0 Dashboard](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/dashboard-auth0-oin.png)</Frame>
Configure the following Auth0 components to set up Express Configuration in your tenant:
* A registered application with login URI
* A Connection Profile
* A User Attribute Profile
* Organization login settings
* Administrator login and consent settings

### Register an application and initiate login URI

1. Register your application as a [Regular Web Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps) or [Single-Page Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps) in Auth0 Dashboard.
2. Once registered, select the application you created and navigate to the **Okta Integration Network** tab to begin the Express Configuration setup wizard.
3. Select **Get Started**.
4. Review the Prerequisites and select **Continue**.
5. Register an **Initiate Login URI Template**. This template implements an endpoint on your application to automatically redirect end-users to Auth0's `/authorize` endpoint for authentication. To review an example of a login endpoint, review the `/login` route in the [Express SDK Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/webapp/express/interactive).
    * After Express Configuration initiates for an application instance, Okta uses the **Initiate Login URI Template** to launch the application from the [end-user dashboard](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/settings/new-dashboard-overview.htm).
    * Optional: Set the `organization_name`, `organization_id,` and `connection_name` for Auth0's `/authorize` endpoint to identify the organization or connection to use. Okta dynamically replaces these variables when the URL is launched from the end-user dashboard. Example: `https://{organization_name}.your-app.com?connection={connection_name}`.
