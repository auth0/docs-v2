</Warning>


The [Okta Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/) is a collection of SaaS applications for which Okta provides an express setup experience for enabling single sign-in with OpenID Connect, automated user provisioning with SCIM, and [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview). Okta administrators use the [Okta Admin Console](https://www.okta.com/okta-administrator-experience) to configure these integrations within their Okta tenant. 

Okta administrators use the Okta Admin Console to configure these integrations within their Okta tenant:

    <Frame>![Okta Administrator Console](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/okta-admin-dash.png)</Frame>

Express Configuration is a feature designed to automate the setup of single sign-on (SSO), SCIM-based user provisioning, and [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview/) for applications with minimal manual effort. It enables enterprise customers to securely configure identity integrations with SaaS applications without the need to copy and paste protocol-specific configuration values.

Express Configuration provides these benefits to Okta administrators and SaaS application developers:

* **Faster configurations**: This feature reduces the time required to set up an application instance by automating the exchange of configuration information between Okta and Auth0. It supports OIDC capabilities through a single control panel, significantly speeding up the overall configuration process for application integration instances.

* **Secure data handling**:  This approach utilizes OAuth 2.0 consent flows for the secure and authorized sharing of sensitive configuration data, thereby reducing potential errors related to credentials and configuration settings.

* **Reduce integration errors**:  Express Configuration simplifies and standardizes the integration deployment process. The automated workflow enables consistent and repeatable deployments of application integrations across multiple customers or environments, supporting a scalable application ecosystem with less opportunity for human error.

* **Better user experience**: Offers an intuitive and efficient configuration interface. The automation eliminates the complexity of manual setup, enabling Okta customer admins to quickly add instances of Auth0-enabled OIN integrations.

## How it works

Auth0 and Okta have introduced the Express Configuration API, which allows Auth0 applications published to the OIN to securely permit selected customers to use Express Configuration on an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) with OpenID Connect, SCIM, and Universal Logout within their Auth0 organization.

The diagram below illustrates an Express Configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN:

<Frame>![express configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN.](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-config-workflow.png)</Frame>

Steps:
1. An Okta administrator signs in to the Okta portal and selects the Express Configuration-enabled application from the OIN.
2. The Okta administrator navigates to the **Sign On** section and select **Express Configure SSO**. This redirects them to an [Auth0 Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/universal-login-vs-classic-login/universal-experience#universal-login-experience) screen.

<Frame>![Okta administrator console > Sign On > Express Configuration](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/okta-express-config-app.png)</Frame>

3. The Okta administrator enters the credentials of an application user who is permitted to perform Express Configuration. In Auth0, this refers to a user who is a member of an [organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) and is authorized to perform Express Configuration using an [organizational role](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/add-member-roles) or other authorization method.

<Frame>![Auth0 Organziation login](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/okta-express-config-auth0-login.png)</Frame>

4. After authenticating, Auth0 prompts the Okta administrator for consent.

<Frame>![Auth0 consent](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-config-auth0-consent.png)</Frame>

5. After consenting, Okta uses the Express Configuration API to automatically configure an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) within the Auth0 organization to which the Okta administrator belongs.

6. The Okta administrator may then assign users to the application instance and see single sign-on working immediately.

Auth0 developers can also configure their OIN integration to allow Express Configuration of SCIM and Universal Logout, both of which are recommended:

* When SCIM is enabled, Okta administrators can configure SCIM by navigating to the **Provisioning** section of the application details and selecting **Express Configure SCIM**. 
* When Universal Logout is enabled, it will be automatically configured as part of the OpenID Connect integration.

<Card title="Before You Start">
To publish an application to the OIN with Express Configuration enabled, Auth0 must have the following:

* An [Okta Integrator Free Plan org](https://developer.okta.com/signup/), with access to either the Super Admin role or the App and Org Admin roles.
* An [Auth0 subscription](https://auth0.com/pricing) that enables the use of the Okta connection type and the Organizations feature for as many customers as you need.
* A SaaS application that has been integrated with Auth0 using a Multi-Organization Architecture.
    * This includes registering your application as a [Regular Web Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps) or [Single-Page Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps) in Auth0, and enabling each of your customers to sign into that application using their own distinct [identity providers](/docs/authenticate/enterprise-connections).
* An [Auth0 Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) is deployed, or can be deployed, for each customer using your SaaS application. Organizations and organizational roles are used to authorize specific users to perform express configuration and create Okta connections only within the organizations to which they belong.
<Note>
**Tip**: To view a sample application that implements a multi-tenant architecture including Auth0 Organizations and organizational roles, refer to the [SaaStart reference application](https://auth0.com/blog/speed-up-your-customer-identity-journey-with-auth0-saastart/).
</Note>

## Configure your application for Express Configuration

The Auth0 Dashboard guides an Auth0 developer through enabling Express Configuration for their application and publishing it to the OIN.

An [Auth0 Admin role](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) in a production Auth0 tenant is required to complete the end-to-end setup and publishing process.
<Frame>![OIN in Auth0 Dashboard](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/dashboard-auth0-oin.png)</Frame>
Configure the following Auth0 components to set up Express Configuration in your tenant:
* A registered application with Initiate Login URI Template
* A Connection Profile
* A User Attribute Profile
* Organization login settings
* Administrator login and consent settings

### Register an application with Initiate Login URI Template

1. Register your application as a [Regular Web Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps) or [Single-Page Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps) in Auth0 Dashboard.
2. Once registered, select the application you created and navigate to the **Okta Integration Network** tab to begin the Express Configuration setup wizard.
3. Select **Get Started**.
4. Review the Prerequisites and select **Continue**.
5. Register an **Initiate Login URI Template**. This template implements an endpoint on your application to automatically redirect end-users to Auth0's `/authorize` endpoint for authentication. To review an example of a login endpoint, review the `/login` route in the [Express SDK Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/webapp/express/interactive).
    * After Express Configuration initiates for an application instance, Okta uses the **Initiate Login URI Template** to launch the application from the [end-user dashboard](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/settings/new-dashboard-overview.htm).
    * Optional: Set the `organization_name`, `organization_id,` and `connection_name` for Auth0's `/authorize` endpoint to identify the organization or connection to use. Okta dynamically replaces these variables when the URL is launched from the end-user dashboard. Example: `https://{organization_name}.your-app.com?connection={connection_name}`.

<Frame>![Dashboard>Applications>OIN>URI-template](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/Dashboard>Applications>OIN>URI-template.png)</Frame>

#### Connection Profile

In the Initiate Login URI Template, you have the option to add a **Connection Profile**. The Connection Profile (CP) enables Auth0 to specify how the private settings of your connections should be configured when created using Express Configuration, including settings that govern how the connection interacts with Auth0’s Universal Login and Organizations features:
    * Options for how the connection name should be created in Auth0
    * Options to use SCIM and/or Universal Logout with the connection (Recommended)
    * Options to allow end users of the connection to automatically become members of the consenting administrator’s organization
    * Options for the **Show as button** setting for the connection on Auth0’s Universal Login page

<Note>
If you do not have a Connection Profile configured, Auth0 provides a default Connection Profile with common and recommended settings implemented for Express-configured connections.
</Note>

To learn how to customize the default CP, read [Connection Profile]().

#### User Attribute Profile
In the Initiate Login URI Template, you have the option to add a **User Attribute Profile**. The User Attribute Profile (UAP) allows Auth0 developers to define, manage, and map user attributes consistently across the various protocols supported by Auth0. When used with Express Configuration, the User Attribute Profile allows developers to customize the OpenID Connect and SCIM attribute maps that will be written to the Okta connection generated by Express Configuration.

<Note>
If you do not have a User Attribute Profile configured, Auth0 provides a default User Attribute Profile with common and recommended mappings for all protocols, including OpenID Connect and SCIM, which are used by the Okta connection type.
</Note>

To learn how to customize the default UAP, read [User Attribute Profile](/docs/authenticate/enterprise-connections/user-attribute-profile).

### Organization login settings

Auth0 Organizations is required to authorize specific organizational users to create isolated connections but is not required to change your application’s existing login flow to support the [organization-based login flow for business users](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/define-organization-behavior).

* If your application currently uses an [Identifier-First login experience](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/identifier-first) and home realm discovery with your applications, see the [Enabling Home Realm Discovery]() section for information on how to enable home realm discovery.
* If you wish to enable multiple applications in `enabled_clients` to be used with your Express Configuration connections, see Enabling Multiple Auth0 Applications Under a Single Integration.

If your application setup does not currently use an organization-based login flow, you can select the **Enable this application for created connections** setting. When enabled, each Express Configuration on an Okta connection is associated directly with your application. Use the required `enabled_clients` setting on the connection.

### Administrator login and consent settings

When Express Configuration is enabled, Auth0 creates an additional client application ID that is used by the OIN during the administrator consent flow between Okta and Auth0. Okta creates one OIN client for each distinct application integration published to the OIN.

Configure administrator login and consent settings in the application you want to publish to the OIN under **Configure Integration Profile**.
1. Navigate to Auth0 Dashboard > Applications.
2. Choose the application you want to publish to the OIN.
3. Select Okta Integration Network.
4. Verify you have the necessary prerequisites and select **Continue**.
5. In the **Configure Integration Profile** section, configure options in **Admin Settings**.

<Frame>![Express Configuration Admin Settings](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/Express-config-admin-settings.png)</Frame>
    * **Admin Login Domain**: Auth0 tenant domain Okta redirects to as part of the consent flow in a Web browser. Use the custom domain name if you have one configured in Auth0. To learn more, read [Custom Domains](docs/customize/custom-domains).
    * **Display Name of the OIN Express Configuration Application**: Name of the OIN client application shown in the consent dialog.
    * **Admin Login Flow**: Defines the [Organization login](/docs/manage-users/organizations/login-flows-for-organizations) flow for the OIN client application and used when an Okta administrator runs Express Configuration from the Okta console. Select from:

        * **Prompt for Organization**: Admins are first asked to select their Organization and are presented with the login experience for their Auth0 Organization. Admins can sign in using a [pre-existing connection](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/enable-connections) configured in that organization.

        * **Prompt for Credentials**: Admins are first asked to provide their login credentials. When this option is selected, a button will appear that allows you to select the connections that contain the admin users. This can be a shared database connection, a passwordless email connection, or another connection that can be associated with all Auth0 Organizations.

    * **Admin Role**:  If you have already deployed Organizations and organizational roles for your customers (as exemplified in the SaaStart reference application), this setting allows you to select a pre-existing organizational role to which you would like to add the Express Configuration permissions. If you are not using roles, read [Assign express configuration permissions to users]() for instructions on how to authorize users.

<Note>
For the best consent experience, set your tenant’s `use_scope_descriptions_for_consent` flag to `true` as described in [Customize Consent Prompts](/docs/customize/login-pages/customize-consent-prompts). You will have the opportunity to view your consent prompt later in when you test and verify your integration.
</Note>

## Assign permissions to users

For Okta,  administrators must have an application user account with required permissions to perform Express Configuration for an Auth0-powered SaaS application.

For Auth0, any application user may be granted this permission, as long as the user is a member of an [Auth0 Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) where the Express-configured connections is created, including:

*   A user in a dedicated database connection that has been created exclusively for a single Organization  
*   A user in a shared database connection who is a member of one or more Organizations
*   A user with a passwordless email connection who is a member of one or more Organizations
*   A user in a social or existing enterprise connection who is a member of one or more Organizations

Once conditions are met, Auth0 provides flexible ways to asign Express Configuration permissions and allow developers to choose the method most appropriate for their curret Auth0 deployment:

| **Method** | **Recommended for...** |
| ----- | ----- |
| Assign Express Configuration permissions to an existing user role | Customers wih existing application user [role](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles) in their Auth0 tenant |
| Assign a new role to application users requiring Express Configuration permissions | Customers who want to use Auth0’s [role](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles) feature to grant Express Configuration permissions to individual users. This can be done withAuth0 Dashboard or the Management API |
| Use a Post-Login Action to  dynamically assign permissions using attribute-based access control | Customers not currently using Auth0’s [role](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles) feature and prefer using a Post-Login Action to dynamically assign permissions based on user attributes instead of using the Auth0 Dashboard or making Management API calls to assign roles |

### Assign permissions to a pre-existing application user role

Use this method of assigning Express Configuration permissions if you use [Auth0’s RBAC feature](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles) for application roles and API permissions and already have one or more roles that represent an administrative user that would be assigned to an IT administrator deploying the application.

Required API permissions:
| **Permission Name** | **API (Resource Server) Identifier** |
| ------ | ------- |
| `express_configure:sso` | `urn:auth0:express-configure` |
| `express_configure:scim` | `urn:auth0:express-configure` |

To learn more about assigning roles in Auth0 Dashboard and Management API, read [Add permissions to roles](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles/add-permissions-to-roles).

### Assign a new role to application users

Use this method of assigning Express Configuration permissions if you use [Auth0’s RBAC feature](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles) for application roles and API permissions, but do not have a role that represents an administrative user, such as an IT administrator, who would be assigned to deploy the application.

This method is also suitable for Auth0 developers who aren’t currently using [Auth0’s RBAC feature](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles) but want to utilize it to gain granular control over which users are allowed access, using either the Auth0 Dashboard or the Management API.

#### Create a role

Use Auth0 Dashboard, Management API, or [Auth0 CLI](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/auth0_roles_create.html) to [create roles](/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles/create-roles). This example uses Auth0 CLI:

```bash
auth0 roles create \
  --name "EXPRESS_CONFIGURE_ADMIN_ROLE" \
  --description "Administrator role for Express Configuration"
  ```

#### Assign permissions to the role

Assign the `express_configuration:sso` and `express_configuration:scim` permissions to the specified role. Replace `$ROLE_ID` with the role ID that you want to grant permission.

<Note>
When using this method, you will need to update your customer onboarding process to assign this role to any new organizational users who require Express Configuration permissions. 
</Note>

```bash
auth0 roles permissions add "$ROLE_ID" \
  --api-id "urn:auth0:express-configure" \
  --permissions "express_configure:sso"
```

```bash
auth0 roles permissions add "$ROLE_ID" \
  --api-id "urn:auth0:express-configure" \
  --permissions "express_configure:scim"
```

To learn more on assigning roles to existing organization users, read [Add member roles](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/add-member-roles ).

### Assign permissions based on user attributes using a post-login Action

Use this method of assigning Express Configuration permissions if you are using Auth0 [post-login Action](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger) to dynamically assign permissions based on user attributes instead of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Mangement API, or Auth0 Dashboard to assign user roles.

This is appropriate for Auth0 customers who have deployed Auth0 using an attribute-based authorization model using custom permissions in [Auth0 metadata](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/metadata).

**Example** <br></br>
The following example uses a post-login Action to assign permissions based on the value of an existing custom user attribute, `user.app_metadata.is_admin`.

```bash
/**
* Assigns Express Configuration permissions based on custom logic instead of role assignment
*/
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {


 //check if request is for EC API access token
 if (event.resource_server && event.resource_server.identifier === "urn:auth0:express-configure") {


   //add permissions based on a custom condition
   if (event.user.app_metadata && event.user.app_metadata.is_admin === true) {
     api.accessToken.addScope("expressconfigure:sso");
     api.accessToken.addScope("expressconfigure:scim");
   }
   //else deny access if EC access token is requested
   else {
     api.access.deny('Access denied');
   }
 }
};
```
## Enable Home realm discovery

<Note>
Before you run Express Configuration, you must collect and verify customer email addresses as part of the customer onboarding process to enable HRD.
</Note>

You can use Express Configuration with Auth0 Actions if your application relies on [Identifier-First login experience](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/identifier-first) and uses home realm discovery (HRD) to match users with their identity providers (IdP) based on the email address.

Email addresses should be stored in a location accessible by post-login Actions during the Express Configuration workflow, including:
* One or more email domains can be stored in [organization metadata](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/create-organizations) on the customer’s Auth0 Organization.
* Your post-login action can make an API call to retrieve verified domains from any system in your environment that stores them.

When the administrative user initiates express configuration in the Okta portal and authenticates, these actions add the email domains to the token that Okta receives, which it extracts and uses to set up the Okta connection with the correct HRD configuration.

**Example 1** <br></br>
In this example, verified domains are stored in connection metadata in the Auth0 Organization, which requires a comma-delimited string of one or more email domains stored in the organization metadata under a key named `domains`.

Example values: `test.com`,`test2.com`

```javascript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
if (event.request.query.audience === "urn:auth0:express-configure") {
  if (event.organization && event.organization.metadata && event.organization.metadata.domains)
  {
    var domain_aliases = event.organization.metadata.domains.replace(/ /g,'').split(',');
    var express_configuration = {
      "domain_aliases": domain_aliases
     };
     api.accessToken.setCustomClaim("express_configuration", express_configuration);
  }
}
};
```
**Example 2** <br></br>
In this example, the post-login Action makes an API call to retrieve verified domains from a storage system in your environment.

```javascript
/**
*/
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
 if (event.request.query.audience === "urn:auth0:express-configure") {
    const axios = require("axios");
    // configure your custom API call here 
    const domains = await axios.get("https://example.org/endpoint");
     var express_configuration = {
     "domain_aliases": domains
      };
      api.accessToken.setCustomClaim("express_configuration", express_configuration);
  
 }
};
```

## Enable multiple applications under a single integration

If you want end-users of a single Express Configuration on an Okta connection to access multiple applications in your tenant, you can set a `linked_clients` property on your registered web application.

To modify this setting, use the Auth0 Management API to [retrieve your registered web application](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/get-clients-by-id). Replace `{yourAppId}` with the Client ID of your registered application, and `{yourAccessToken}` with a Management APIv2 access token. To learn how to get an access token to use the Management API, read [Management API Access Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens).
``` curl
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/clients/{yourAppId}' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer {yourAccessToken}'
```

Extract the `express_configuration` property from the response, add an array of additional application IDs to a `linked_clients` property, and [update your registered web application](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id):

```curl
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/clients/{yourAppId}' \
  --data '{"express_configuration": 
  {"admin_login_domain":"TENANT.auth0.com",
    "connection_profile_id":"cop_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "enable_client":true,
    "enable_organization":true,
    "initiate_login_uri_template":"https://example.org",
    "okta_oin_client_id":"LDiGbUeiAYjRB5a4yOGfBvxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "user_attribute_profile_id":"uap_1ctMVQUg8jxxxxxxxxxxxx",   

     "linked_clients": [ 
        { "client_id": "KJM86F2susguvsasSeAsIxxxxxxxxxxx" }, 
	  { "client_id": "FIXwZCf5iUElvqy6eidlfxxxxxxxxxxx" }
      ] 
     }
  }' \
  --header 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer {yourAccessToken}'
```

When Express Configuration is run, all of these application IDs in the linked_clients property will be added to the `enabled_clients` property of the Okta connection.

## Publish your integration to the OIN

After you create a base configuration, you are ready to start the submission process to the OIN. As part of this process, you will be able to fully test Express Configuration end-to-end prior to going live:

    1. Register your application in the OIN
    2. Request an Express Configuration integration
    3. Configure your OIN public key
    4. Test and verify your Express Configuration integration
    5. Finalize your OIN submission

### Register your application in the OIN

To add Express Configuration to a new or pre-existing application in the OIN, you need:

* An instance of your Auth0-enabled web application to use for testing
* An [Okta Integrator Free Plan org](https://developer.okta.com/signup/), with access to either the Super Admin role or the App and Org Admin roles.
    * Your Okta Integrator Free Plan org must be configured as an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) in your Auth0 tenant and enabled for use with your Auth0-enabled web application in order to complete basic tests
* Google Chrome browser with the Okta Browser Plugin installed (review [OIN Wizard requirements](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#oin-wizard-requirements))

1. Sign in to your Okta Integrator Free Plan org with the user account you used to sign up with, or with an account that has been assigned the `SUPER_ADMIN` role, or the `APP_ADMIN` and `ORG_ADMIN` admin roles in Okta.
2. Navigate to to **Applications > Your OIN Integrations** in the Admin Console.
3. If this is a new application, select **Build new OIN integration**. Otherwise, select your existing OIN Integration. The OIN Wizard appears:

<Frame>![Configure Okta OIN](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-configuration-oin.png)</Frame>

 4. Under **Add integration capabilities**, select **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** as the SSO protocol.
 5. You may optionally select **Universal Logout** and **SCIM 2.0**, both of which are highly recommended for all Okta integrations and supported with Express Configuration.
 6. Select **Configure your integration**.
 7. Complete the **OIN Catalog Properties** section as desired. For reference, read [OIN Catalog Properties](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/openidconnect/main/#oin-catalog-properties).
 8. Under **OIDC Properties**, set the following fields:<p></p>
    A. **Redirect URIs** should be the callback URI for your Auth0 tenant. This can use your tenant’s custom domain, or your auth0.com domain. <br></br>Example: `https://tenant.auth0.com/login/callback`<p></p>
    B. Optional, set **Initiate Login URI** to the same value you configured for your application in Auth0, as described in Auth0 application and initiate login URI. Okta will use this URL to launch your application from the [end-user dashboard](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/settings/new-dashboard-overview.htm). <br></br> Example: `https://{organization_name}.your-app.com?connection={connection_name}`<p></p>
    C. Optional. Set **Post-Logout URL** to the sign-out redirect URIs for your app. This is the location where you want to send your end user after they sign out of your app. You can use integration variables if your sign-out URI varies per tenant. <p></p>
    D. Set **Configuration guide URL** to link to your customer-facing instructions on how to configure SSO between Okta and your app with Express Configuration. To learn more, read [Customer configuration document guidelines](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#customer-configuration-document-guidelines).

    <Frame>![OIN OIDC Settings](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-configuration-oin-oidc-settings.png)</Frame>

9. If **Universal Logout** is selected, set the following fields under Universal logout properties:
    A. Set **Global token revocation** endpoint to your Auth0 tenant name. This value will be dynamically replaced when Express Configuration runs.<p></p>
    B. Under **Subject format**, select issuer and **Subject identifier**.<p></p>
    C. Check **Partial support** if you do not use [OIDC back-channel](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout/universal-logout#revoke-application-user-sessions) logout between Auth0 and your application.<p></p>

    <Frame>![Okta Admin Console Universal Logout Settings](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-configuration-oin-universal-logout.png)</Frame>

    

    ## Limitations
    * Only one Auth0 tenant can be used in a single OIN integration. If the same application is deployed in multiple Auth0 regions, each region requires its own OIN integration
    * One OIN integration in one Okta organization can create one unique Okta connection in one corresponding Auth0 organization. Express configuration is not supported for more than one instance of an OIN application within an Okta organization 
    * Each unique integration listed in the OIN creates an independent Okta connection. If you have multiple applications that require an [Identifier-First login experience]() with home realm discovery, we recommend publishing [multiple applications under a single integration](). 
    * When enabling [multiple applications under a single integration](), Okta only shows the main OIN application in its [end-user dashboard]().
