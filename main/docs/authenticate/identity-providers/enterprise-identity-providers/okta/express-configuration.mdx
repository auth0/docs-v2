The [Okta Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/) is a collection of SaaS applications for which Okta provides an express setup experience for enabling single sign-in with OpenID Connect, automated user provisioning with SCIM, and [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview). Okta administrators use the [Okta Admin Console](https://www.okta.com/okta-administrator-experience) to configure these integrations within their Okta tenant. 

Okta administrators use the Okta Admin Console to configure these integrations within their Okta tenant:

Express Configuration is a feature designed to automate the setup of single sign-on (SSO), SCIM-based user provisioning, and [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview/) for applications with minimal manual effort. It enables enterprise customers to securely configure identity integrations with SaaS applications without the need to copy and paste protocol-specific configuration values.

Express Configuration provides these benefits to Okta administrators and SaaS application developers:

* **Faster configurations**: This feature reduces the time required to set up an application instance by automating the exchange of configuration information between Okta and Auth0. It supports OIDC capabilities through a single control panel, significantly speeding up the overall configuration process for application integration instances.

* **Secure data handling**:  This approach utilizes OAuth 2.0 consent flows for the secure and authorized sharing of sensitive configuration data, thereby reducing potential errors related to credentials and configuration settings.

* **Reduce integration errors**:  Express Configuration simplifies and standardizes the integration deployment process. The automated workflow enables consistent and repeatable deployments of application integrations across multiple customers or environments, supporting a scalable application ecosystem with less opportunity for human error.

* **Better user experience**: Offers an intuitive and efficient configuration interface. The automation eliminates the complexity of manual setup, enabling Okta customer admins to quickly add instances of Auth0-enabled OIN integrations.

## How it works

Auth0 and Okta have introduced the Express Configuration API, which allows Auth0 applications published to the OIN to securely permit selected customers to express-configure an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) with OpenID Connect, SCIM, and Universal Logout within their Auth0 organization.

The diagram below illustrates an Express Configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN:

<Frame>![express configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN.](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-config-workflow.png)</Frame>

Steps:
1. An Okta administrator signs in to the Okta portal and selects the Express Configuration-enabled application from the OIN.
2. The Okta administrator navigates to the **Sign On** section and select **Express Configure SSO**. This redirects them to an [Auth0 Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/universal-login-vs-classic-login/universal-experience#universal-login-experience) screen.

<Frame>![Okta administrator console > Sign On > Express Configuration](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/okta-express-config-app.png)</Frame>

3. The Okta administrator enters the credentials of an application user who is permitted to perform Express Configuration. In Auth0, this refers to a user who is a member of an [organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) and is authorized to perform Express Configuration using an [organizational role](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/add-member-roles) or other authorization method.

<Frame>![Auth0 Organziation login](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/okta-express-config-auth0-login.png)</Frame>

4. After authenticating, Auth0 prompts the Okta administrator for consent.

<Frame>![Auth0 consent](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-config-auth0-consent.png)</Frame>

5. After consenting, Okta uses the Express Configuration API to automatically configure an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) within the Auth0 organization to which the Okta administrator belongs.

6. The Okta administrator may then assign users to the application instance and see single sign-on working immediately.

Auth0 developers can also configure their OIN integration to allow Express Configuration of SCIM and Universal Logout, both of which are recommended:

* When SCIM is enabled, Okta administrators can configure SCIM by navigating to the **Provisioning** section of the application details and selecting **Express Configure SCIM**. 
* When Universal Logout is enabled, it will be automatically configured as part of the OpenID Connect integration.

<Card title="Before You Start">
To publish an application to the OIN with Express Configuration enabled, Auth0 must have the following:

* An [Okta Integrator Free Plan org](https://developer.okta.com/signup/), with access to either the Super Admin role or the App and Org Admin roles.
* An [Auth0 subscription](https://auth0.com/pricing) that enables the use of the Okta connection type and the Organizations feature for as many customers as you need.
* A SaaS application that has been integrated with Auth0 using a Multi-Organization Architecture.
    * This includes registering your application as a [Regular Web Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps) or [Single-Page Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps) in Auth0, and enabling each of your customers to sign into that application using their own distinct [identity providers](/docs/authenticate/enterprise-connections).
* An [Auth0 Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) is deployed, or can be deployed, for each customer using your SaaS application. Organizations and organizational roles are used to authorize specific users to perform express configuration and create Okta connections only within the organizations to which they belong.
<Note>
**Tip**: To view a sample application that implements a multi-tenant architecture including Auth0 Organizations and organizational roles, refer to the [SaaStart reference application](https://auth0.com/blog/speed-up-your-customer-identity-journey-with-auth0-saastart/).

## Configure you application for Express Configuration

The Auth0 Dashboard guides an Auth0 developer through enabling Express Configuration for their application and publishing it to the OIN.

An [Auth0 Admin role](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) in a production Auth0 tenant is required to complete the end-to-end setup and publishing process.
<Frame>![OIN in Auth0 Dashboard](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/dashboard-auth0-oin.png)</Frame>
Configure the following Auth0 components to set up Express Configuration in your tenant:
* A registered application with Initiate Login URI Template
* A Connection Profile
* A User Attribute Profile
* Organization login settings
* Administrator login and consent settings

### Register an application with Initiate Login URI Template

1. Register your application as a [Regular Web Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps) or [Single-Page Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/single-page-web-apps) in Auth0 Dashboard.
2. Once registered, select the application you created and navigate to the **Okta Integration Network** tab to begin the Express Configuration setup wizard.
3. Select **Get Started**.
4. Review the Prerequisites and select **Continue**.
5. Register an **Initiate Login URI Template**. This template implements an endpoint on your application to automatically redirect end-users to Auth0's `/authorize` endpoint for authentication. To review an example of a login endpoint, review the `/login` route in the [Express SDK Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/webapp/express/interactive).
    * After Express Configuration initiates for an application instance, Okta uses the **Initiate Login URI Template** to launch the application from the [end-user dashboard](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/settings/new-dashboard-overview.htm).
    * Optional: Set the `organization_name`, `organization_id,` and `connection_name` for Auth0's `/authorize` endpoint to identify the organization or connection to use. Okta dynamically replaces these variables when the URL is launched from the end-user dashboard. Example: `https://{organization_name}.your-app.com?connection={connection_name}`.

<Frame>![Dashboard>Applications>OIN>URI-template](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/Dashboard>Applications>OIN>URI-template.png)</Frame>

#### Connection Profile

In the Initiate Login URI Template, you have the option to add a **Connection Profile**. The Connection Profile (CP) enables Auth0 to specify how the private settings of your connections should be configured when created using Express Configuration, including settings that govern how the connection interacts with Auth0’s Universal Login and Organizations features:
    * Options for how the connection name should be created in Auth0
    * Options to use SCIM and/or Universal Logout with the connection (Recommended)
    * Options to allow end users of the connection to automatically become members of the consenting administrator’s organization
    * Options for the **Show as button** setting for the connection on Auth0’s Universal Login page

<Note>
If you do not have a Connection Profile configured, Auth0 provides a default Connection Profile with common and recommended settings implemented for `express-configured` connections.
</Note>

To learn how to customize the default CP, read [Connection Profile]().

#### User Attribute Profile
In the Initiate Login URI Template, you have the option to add a **User Attribute Profile**. The User Attribute Profile (UAP) allows Auth0 developers to define, manage, and map user attributes consistently across the various protocols supported by Auth0. When used with Express Configuration, the User Attribute Profile allows developers to customize the OpenID Connect and SCIM attribute maps that will be written to the Okta connection generated by Express Configuration.

<Note>
If you do not have a User Attribute Profile configured, Auth0 provides a default User Attribute Profile with common and recommended mappings for all protocols, including OpenID Connect and SCIM, which are used by the Okta connection type.
</Note>

To learn how to customize the default UAP, read [User Attribute Profile](/docs/authenticate/enterprise-connections/user-attribute-profile).

### Organization login settings

Auth0 Organizations is required to authorize specific organizational users to create isolated connections but is not required to change your application’s existing login flow to support the [organization-based login flow for business users](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/define-organization-behavior).

* If your application currently uses an [Identifier-First login experience](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/identifier-first) and home realm discovery with your applications, see the [Enabling Home Realm Discovery]() section for information on how to enable home realm discovery.
* If you wish to enable multiple applications in `enabled_clients` to be used with your `express-configured` connections, see Enabling Multiple Auth0 Applications Under a Single Integration.

If your application setup does not currently use an organization-based login flow, you can select the **Enable this application for created connections** setting. When enabled, each `express-configured` Okta connection is associated directly with your application. Use the required `enabled_clients` setting on the connection.

### Administrator login and consent settings

When Express Configuration is enabled, Auth0 creates an additional client application ID that is used by the OIN during the administrator consent flow between Okta and Auth0. Okta creates one OIN client for each distinct application integration published to the OIN.

Configure administrator login and consent settings in the application you want to publish to the OIN under **Configure Integration Profile**.
1. Navigate to Auth0 Dashboard > Applications.
2. Choose the application you want to publish to the OIN.
3. Select Okta Integration Network.
4. Verify you have the necessary prerequisites and select **Continue**.
5. In the **Configure Integration Profile** section, configure options in **Admin Settings**.

<Frame>![Express Configuration Admin Settings](main/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/Express-config-admin-settings.png)</Frame>
    * **Admin Login Domain**: Auth0 tenant domain Okta redirects to as part of the consent flow in a Web browser. Use the custom domain name if you have one configured in Auth0. To learn more, read [Custom Domains](docs/customize/custom-domains).
    * **Display Name of the OIN Express Configuration Application**: Name of the OIN client application shown in the consent dialog.
    * **Admin Login Flow**: Defines the [Organization login](/docs/manage-users/organizations/login-flows-for-organizations) flow for the OIN client application and used when an Okta administrator runs Express Configuration from the Okta console. Select from:

        * **Prompt for Organization**: Admins are first asked to select their Organization and are presented with the login experience for their Auth0 Organization. Admins can sign in using a [pre-existing connection](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/enable-connections) configured in that organization.

        * **Prompt for Credentials**: Admins are first asked to provide their login credentials. When this option is selected, a button will appear that allows you to select the connections that contain the admin users. This can be a shared database connection, a passwordless email connection, or another connection that can be associated with all Auth0 Organizations.

    * **Admin Role**:  If you have already deployed Organizations and organizational roles for your customers (as exemplified in the SaaStart reference application), this setting allows you to select a pre-existing organizational role to which you would like to add the Express Configuration permissions. If you are not using roles, read [Assign express configuration permissions to users]() for instructions on how to authorize users.

<Note>
For the best consent experience, set your tenant’s `use_scope_descriptions_for_consent` flag to `true` as described in [Customize Consent Prompts](/docs/customize/login-pages/customize-consent-prompts). You will have the opportunity to view your consent prompt later in when you test and verify your integration.
