<Warning>
Express Configuration is currently in Early Access. By using this feature, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/legal). To learn more about Auth0's product release cycle, read [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages). To particpate in Express Configuration, contact [Auth0 Support](https://support.auth0.com).
</Warning>


The [Okta Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/) is a collection of SaaS applications for which Okta provides an express setup experience for enabling single sign-in with OpenID Connect, automated user provisioning with SCIM, and [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview). Okta administrators use the [Okta Admin Console](https://www.okta.com/okta-administrator-experience) to configure these integrations within their Okta tenant:

Express Configuration enables enterprise customers to securely configure identity integrations with SaaS applications without the need to copy and paste protocol-specific configuration values.

Express Configuration provides these benefits to Okta administrators and SaaS application developers:

* **Faster configurations**: This feature reduces the time required to set up an application instance by automating the exchange of configuration information between Okta and Auth0. It supports OIDC capabilities through a single control panel, significantly speeding up the overall configuration process for application integration instances.

* **Secure data handling**:  This approach utilizes OAuth 2.0 consent flows for the secure and authorized sharing of sensitive configuration data, thereby reducing potential errors related to credentials and configuration settings.

* **Reduce integration errors**:  Express Configuration simplifies and standardizes the integration deployment process. The automated workflow enables consistent and repeatable deployments of application integrations across multiple customers or environments, supporting a scalable application ecosystem with less opportunity for human error.

* **Better user experience**: Offers an intuitive and efficient configuration interface. The automation eliminates the complexity of manual setup, enabling Okta customer admins to quickly add instances of Auth0-enabled OIN integrations.

## How it works

Auth0 and Okta have introduced the Express Configuration API, which allows Auth0 applications published to the OIN to securely permit selected customers to use Express Configuration on an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) with OpenID Connect, SCIM, and Universal Logout within their Auth0 organization.

The diagram below illustrates an Express Configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN:

<Frame>![express configuration workflow for an Auth0 app in the OIN.](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/express-config-workflow.png)</Frame>

* An Okta administrator signs in to the Okta portal and selects the Express Configuration-enabled application from the OIN.
* The Okta administrator navigates to the **Sign On** section and select **Express Configure SSO**. This redirects them to an [Auth0 Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/universal-login-vs-classic-login/universal-experience#universal-login-experience) screen.

* The Okta administrator enters the credentials of an application user who is permitted to perform Express Configuration. In Auth0, this refers to a user who is a member of an [organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations) and is authorized to perform Express Configuration using an [organizational role](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/add-member-roles) or other authorization method.

* After authenticating, Auth0 prompts the Okta administrator for consent.

* After consenting, Okta uses the Express Configuration API to automatically configure an [Okta connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) within the Auth0 organization to which the Okta administrator belongs.

* The Okta administrator may then assign users to the application instance and see single sign-on working immediately.

Auth0 developers can also configure their OIN integration to allow Express Configuration of SCIM and Universal Logout, both of which are recommended:

* When SCIM is enabled, Okta administrators can configure SCIM by navigating to the **Provisioning** section of the application details and selecting **Express Configure SCIM**. 
* When Universal Logout is enabled, it will be automatically configured as part of the OpenID Connect integration.

## Limitations
* Only one Auth0 tenant can be used in a single OIN integration. If the same application is deployed in multiple Auth0 regions, each region requires its own OIN integration
* One OIN integration in one Okta organization can create one unique Okta connection in one corresponding Auth0 organization. Express configuration is not supported for more than one instance of an OIN application within an Okta organization 
* Each unique integration listed in the OIN creates an independent Okta connection. If you have multiple applications that require an [Identifier-First login experience]() with home realm discovery, we recommend publishing [multiple applications under a single integration](). 
* When enabling [multiple applications under a single integration](), Okta only shows the main OIN application in its [end-user dashboard]().
