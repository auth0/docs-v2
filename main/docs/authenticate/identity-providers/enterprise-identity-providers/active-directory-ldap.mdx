Auth0 integrates with Active Directory (AD) using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) through an **Active Directory/LDAP Connector** that you install on your network.

The **AD/LDAP Connector** (1), is a bridge between your **Active Directory/LDAP** (2) and the **Auth0 Service** (3). This bridge is necessary because AD/LDAP is typically restricted to your internal network, and Auth0 is a cloud service running in a completely different context.

<Frame>![Overview Diagram of AD/LDAP Connector](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/2HT4cRvUDzA2OdEPlfgLDV/be32ffe82562dc8f07fdd2097f14d881/ldap-connect.png)</Frame>

For [high availability and load balancing](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/active-directory-ldap/ad-ldap-connector/ad-ldap-high-availability), you can install multiple instances of the connector. All connections are outbound from the connector to the Auth0 Server, so changes to your firewall are generally unnecessary.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning:

* [Register your Application with Auth0](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications).

  + Select an appropriate **Application Type**.
  + Add an **Allowed Callback URL** of `{https://yourApp/callback}`.
  + Make sure your Application's [**Grant Types**](/docs/get-started/applications/update-grant-types) include the appropriate flows.

## Steps

To connect your application to Active Directory/LDAP, you must:

1. [Create an enterprise connection in Auth0](#create-an-enterprise-connection-in-auth0) and download the installer
2. [Install the connector on your network](#install-the-connector-on-your-network)
3. [Enable the enterprise connection for your Auth0 Application](#enable-the-enterprise-connection-for-your-auth0-application)
4. [Test the connection](#test-the-connection)

## Create an enterprise connection in Auth0

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Enterprise](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/enterprise), locate **Active Directory / LDAP**, and select its `+`.

   <Frame>![Dashboard - Connections - Enterprise](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/1fSTcrZpkgkPR64NnI1lr8/b3454e60a4463e99353603fd11a71983/Enterprise_Connections_-_EN.png)</Frame>
2. Enter details for your connection, and select **Create**:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Connection name</strong></td>
<td>Logical identifier for your connection; it must be unique for your tenant. Once set, this name can't be changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Display name</strong> (optional)</td>
<td>Text used to customize the login button for Universal Login. When set, the Universal Login login button reads: "Continue with \{Display name}".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Logo URL</strong> (optional)</td>
<td>URL of image used to customize the login button for Universal Login. When set, the Universal Login login button displays the image as a 20px by 20px square.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>IdP Domains</strong> (optional)</td>
<td>Comma-separated list of valid email domains that will be allowed to log in using this connection. Only needed if using the Lock login widget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Disable cache</strong></td>
<td>When enabled, disables caching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Use client SSL certificate authentication</strong></td>
<td>When enabled, uses client SSL certificate authentication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Use Windows Integrated Auth (Kerberos)</strong></td>
<td>When enabled, you will be asked to enter a range of IP addresses. When users log in through these IP addresses, Kerberos will be used; otherwise, AD/LDAP username/password will be requested. Typically, the IP range entered represent intranet addresses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sync user profile attributes at each login</strong></td>
<td>When enabled, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

3. Download the provided installer and make note of the provided **Provisioning Ticket URL**.

## Install the connector on your network

Set up the [AD/LDAP Connector](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/active-directory-ldap/ad-ldap-connector) by following the instructions for your platform:

* [Install the AD/LDAP Connector on Windows](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/active-directory-ldap/ad-ldap-connector/install-configure-ad-ldap-connector)
* [Install the AD/LDAP Connector on Non-Microsoft Platforms](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/active-directory-ldap/ad-ldap-connector/install-configure-ad-ldap-connector)

## Enable the enterprise connection for your Auth0 application

To use your new AD connection, you must first [enable the connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/enable-enterprise-connections) for your Auth0 Applications.

## Test the connection

Now you're ready to [test your connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/test-enterprise-connections).

## Next Steps

* [Integrate with Auth0 using one of our libraries](/docs/libraries)
* [Integrate with Auth0 using our Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication)
* [Read more about the authentication flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow)
* [Pass additional parameters to the Identity Provider](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/pass-parameters-to-idps)
* [Re-prompt users for permissions](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/reprompt-permissions)
