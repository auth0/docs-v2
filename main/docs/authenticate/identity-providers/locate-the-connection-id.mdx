title: Locate the Connection ID or Name
---
Some user management tasks require a connection ID, which is a unique identifier for a source of users. For example, if you import or export users or connect to <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+providers">identity providers</Tooltip>, you must provide a connection ID.

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), select **Authentication**, then select the type of connection for which you need the ID.
2. Select the name of the connection for which you need the ID.
3. On the **Settings** view, locate the **Name** field; it contains the connection ID.
