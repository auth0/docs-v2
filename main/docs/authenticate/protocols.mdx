There are a set of open specifications and protocols that specify how to design an authentication and authorization system. They specify how you should manage identity, move personal data securely, and decide who can access applications and data.

The identity industry standards that we use at Auth0 are:

* Open Authorization (<Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth">OAuth</Tooltip>) 1: the original standard for access delegation. Used as a way for a user to grant websites access to their information on other websites or apps, but without giving them the credentials.
* [Open Authorization (OAuth) 2](/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth): an authorization standard that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site to another site, without having to expose their credentials. You use this standard every time you log in to a site using your Google account and you are asked if you agree with sharing your email address and your contacts list with that site.
* [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol): an identity layer that sits on top of OAuth 2 and allows for easy verification of the user's identity, as well as the ability to get basic profile information from the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip>.
* [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/active-directory-ldap/ad-ldap-connector): an application protocol used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. The function of LDAP is to enable access to an existing directory like Active Directory (AD). Auth0 uses a connector that you install on your network to integrate with AD/LDAP.
* [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens): an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
* [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-configuration): an open-standard, XML-based data format that allows businesses to communicate user authentication and authorization information to partner companies and enterprise applications their employees may use.
* [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)](/docs/authenticate/protocols/scim): a set of application-level protocols to securely manage and communicate user data across multiple domains. SCIM clients can be integrated to manage CRUD (create, replace, update, delete) operations, apply queries and filters, and create user groups within your organization.
* [WS-Federation (WS-Fed)](/docs/authenticate/protocols/ws-fed-protocol): a standard developed by Microsoft, and used extensively in their applications. It defines the way <Tooltip tip="Security Token: Digitally-signed artifact used to prove that the user was successfully authenticated." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=security+tokens">security tokens</Tooltip> can be transported between different entities to exchange identity and authorization information.
