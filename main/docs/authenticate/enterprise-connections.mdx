Auth0 provides Enterprise connections to authenticate users in an external, federated <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> (IdP) such as Azure AD, Google Workspace, PingFederate, and more.

## Create an Enterprise connection

Auth0 supports many identity providers out of the box. To learn more, review [Enterprise Identity Providers](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers).

#### OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol

Enterprise connections using <Tooltip tip="OpenID: Open standard for authentication that allows applications to verify users' identities without collecting and storing login information." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OpenID">OpenID</Tooltip> Connect or Okta Workforce as the identity provider can support the following:

* Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

  + For more information on PKCE, review [Protecting Apps with PKCE](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/).
* Attribute claims and <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip> mapping
* UserInfo integration

You can currently implement these features for [OpenID Connect](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/oidc) or [Okta Workforce](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/okta) connections. To learn more, review [Configure PKCE and Claim Mapping for OIDC Connections](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/configure-pkce-claim-mapping-for-oidc).

## View Enterprise connections

<Tabs><Tab title="Dashboard">

Navigate to [**Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Enterprise**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/enterprise) to see all available Enterprise connection types. Select a connection type (for example, SAML) to see if there are any configured connections of that type.

You can also select a configured connection and check the **Applications** tab to see if it is enabled for any applications.

</Tab><Tab title="Management API">

Call the Auth0 Management API [Get all Connections endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Connections/get_connections) to get information about your connections. Include the `strategy` parameter to filter by connection type.

The Enterprise connection type `strategy` values are:

* `ad` (Active Directory/LDAP)
* `adfs` (ADFS)
* `auth0-adldap`
* `google-apps` (Google Workspace)
* `ip`
* `office365`
* `oidc` (OpenID Connect)
* `pingfederate` (PingFederate)
* `samlp` (SAML)
* `sharepoint`
* `waad` (Microsoft Azure AD)

## What is an active Enterprise connection?

An Enterprise connection is considered active if (during the current month) it has both:

* Been enabled for an application.
* Had user activity (for example, login, sign-up, or token exchange).

If an Enterprise connection was never enabled for any application, or was enabled but did not have any user activity during the current month, it is not considered active.

The Okta Workforce Enterprise connection is not counted toward your active Enterprise connections limit.
