Some of the key capabilities of Forms include:

* A controlled and secure experience within your tenant's domain. No need to [Redirect](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/redirect-with-actions) users to external sites.
* Pre-built components with frontend and backend validations.
* Custom business logic with out-of-the-box integrations with third parties.
* Consistent branding experience with <Tooltip tip="Universal Login: Your application redirects to Universal Login, hosted on Auth0's Authorization Server, to verify a user's identity." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Universal+Login">Universal Login</Tooltip>.

Using Forms enables you to build use cases like:

* **Progressive profiling:** Define a set of conditions to require users to complete additional information as they engage with your product. For example, when users login for a third-time, you can require them to complete their profile.
* **Custom policies acceptance:** If you need to update your policies, you can define logic to check if users have accepted the latest policies, and depending on that, display a custom form to users requiring acceptance.
* **Custom signup or login steps:** Extend and customize your flows with additional steps and custom logic. For example, you can verify email or phone numbers with OTP and account linking, or verify payment details with Stripe, and more.
