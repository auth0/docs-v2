Once you create a form, you can render it with [Actions](/docs/customize/actions) using the `api.prompt.render()` method:

```javascript lines
// Example using the post-login trigger

exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  api.prompt.render(':form_id');
}

exports.onContinuePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  // Add your logic after completing the form
}
```






Replace form_id with the ID of the Form. You can locate the ID in the URL of the Form, for example:  `ap_pUMG...` or select it from the Form editor **Render** tab.
In the [Actions Code editor](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action#create-an-action), you can define the business logic to decide when and how to render the Form.

```javascript lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {

  // Only render the form if user is missing company_name metadata
  if (!event.user.user_metadata.company_name) {
    api.prompt.render(':form_id');
  }
}

exports.onContinuePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  // Add your logic after completing the form
}
```






To learn more these objects, review:

* [Event Object](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-event-object): Learn about the Event objects and properties.
* [API object](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-api-object): Learn about the API objects and methods.

## Populate values for existing fields and hidden fields (client-side)

You can populate values for existing fields and hidden fields using the `fields` property as a second argument in your render method.

In the example below, the value `Jane` populates `first_name` field.

```javascript lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  api.prompt.render(':form_id', {
    fields: {
      first_name: 'Jane',
    }
  });
}

exports.onContinuePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  // Add your logic after completing the form
}
```






<Warning>

Do not populate sensitive information, populated values are exposed to the browser (client-side).

</Warning>

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Make sure that the field `ID` referenced in the second argument is available client-side in your [nodes and components](/docs/customize/forms/nodes-and-components); otherwise, the value will not populate.

</Callout>

## Inject custom data with shared variables (server-side)

You can inject server-side variables using the `vars` property as a second argument in your render method. This can be used to inject sensitive information without exposing it to the client-side.

In the example below, the value `123456789` populates the variable `external_user_id`.

```javascript lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  api.prompt.render(':form_id', {
    vars: {
      external_user_id: '123456789',
    }
  });
}

exports.onContinuePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  // Add your logic after completing the form
}
```






<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Shared variables `{{vars.*}}` do not have data type restrictions.

Shared variables `{{vars.*}}` are always automatically masked.

Unlike when populating `{{fields.*}}` variables, the `{{vars.*}}` property does not need to exist in your form before injecting values.

You can use the `{{vars.*}}` property to reference shared variables in your Forms and its linked Flows. To learn more, read [Variables](/docs/customize/forms/variables).

</Callout>

## Fields and shared variables data in Actions

Fields and shared variables data collected, in your forms, is automatically available with the `event.prompt` in the resume function of the current action:

* The `id` property, with the prompt ID you're rendering.
* The `fields` object, which contains all your fields and hidden fields data.
* The `vars` object, which contains all your shared variables data.



<Accordion title="Example of event.prompt object">

```json lines
{
  "id": "ap_fuVuFiiQWN3mTEujWTy966",
  "fields": {
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "company_name": "Okta"
  },
  "vars": {
    "external_crm_uuid": "f8f32e6f-2329-49bd-bf21-fa8b0bea2652",
    "api_hostname": "api.example.com"
  }
}
```






</Accordion>



In the example below, the `api.user.setUserMetadata` populates the `user_metadata` `company_name` attribute with the `event.prompt.fields.company_name` property that was collected from your form.

```javascript lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  api.prompt.render(':form_id');
}

exports.onContinuePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  api.user.setUserMetadata('company_name', event.prompt.fields.company_name);
}
```






## Restrictions and limitations

* You cannot [redirect](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/redirect-with-actions) a user and render a form in the same Action. If you need to use both, consider using different Actions.
* You can only render one form per Action. If you need to render more than one form, you need to render the forms in different Actions.
* The same form can not be rendered more than once across the same trigger.
  For example, if you have a `post-login` trigger with two Actions, you can not render the same form in both Actions, you need to create different Forms for each Action.
* The `fields` property size limit is 24 KB.
* The `api.prompt.render()` method is available in the following triggers:

  + [post-login](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-api-object)
  + [post-challenge](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/password-reset-triggers/post-challenge-trigger/post-challenge-api-object)
