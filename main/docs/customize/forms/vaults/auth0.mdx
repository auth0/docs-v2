## Get access to Auth0 Management API

[Create a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/machine-to-machine-apps) authorized for Auth0 Management API.

<Warning>

Remember to authorize your M2M Application to access the Management API and select the right scopes following the Least Privilege Principle:
- For Get User: `read:users`
- For Create User: `create:users`
- For Update User: `update:users`

</Warning>
