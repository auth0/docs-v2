Auth0 allows you to configure your own SMTP email provider so you can more completely manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications. Auth0's built-in email infrastructure should be used for testing emails only.

## Prerequisites

* To ensure that emails can be sent from Auth0 to your SMTP, open ports and allow inbound connections from specific IP addresses. To update the list of IPs, navigate to [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider). See [Add IP Addresses to AllowList](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist) for details.
* You must have a [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) account.

## Configure Mailgun

1. Log in to your [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com).
2. Navigate to Mailgun **Sending > Domains**, and add your custom domain. Mailgun allows sending emails from only verified domains.
3. Navigate to Mailgun **Settings > API Keys**. Your API key was created when you signed up for your account; copy it from **Private API Key**.
4. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
5. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
6. Click the **Mailgun** logo.
7. Provide a **From** email address, enter the **Domain** you previously added to Mailgun, enter the Mailgun **API Key** you previously copied, select your **Region**.
8. Click **Save**.

## Test email

You can now send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If you have configured everything correctly, you will receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, please check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for any failures.

The [Mailgun Dashboard](https://app.mailgun.com/app/dashboard) will now display delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
