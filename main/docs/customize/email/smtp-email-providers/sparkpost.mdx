description: Instructions on how to configure SparkPost as an email provider with Auth0.
---

## Prerequisites

* You must have a [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/) account.

* You must configure your provider to allow inbound connections from specific [Auth0 IP addresses](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

## Configure SparkPost

1. Log in to your [SparkPost](https://www.sparkpost.com/) account.
2. Navigate to SparkPost [Sending Domains](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/sending-domains), and add your custom domain. SparkPost allows sending emails from only verified domains.
3. Navigate to SparkPost [Account API Keys](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/credentials), and click **New API key**. Save this key value and ensure it has `Transmissions: Read/Write` access. Copy this key value.
4. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
5. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
6. Click the **SparkPost** logo.
7. Provide a **From** email address, enter the SparkPost **API Key** you previously copied, select your **Region**. If you are changing to the EU region in an account that was already configured for the US region, you must replace the **API Key** in Auth0 with a Sparkpost EU API Key.
8. Click **Save**.

## Send a test email

Send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If the configuration is correct, you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for error codes.

If you haven't registered a <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domain">custom domain</Tooltip> with SparkPost, you can send a maximum of five test emails from the `sparkpostbox.com` domain. For more details, see SparkPost's [Transmissions: The Sandox Domain](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/transmissions.html#header-the-sandbox-domain).

Once configured, the SparkPost [Message Events](https://app.sparkpost.com/reports/message-events) page displays delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
