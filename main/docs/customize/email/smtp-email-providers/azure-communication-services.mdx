## Prerequisites

* You must have an [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account.

* You must configure your provider to allow inbound connections from specific [Auth0 IP addresses](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

## Configure Azure Communication Services

First, create a resource in Microsoft Azure:

1. Log in to your [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account.
2. Create a [Communication Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#create-azure-communication-services-resource)resource if you do not have one.
3. Enter "Communication Services" in the search bar.
4. Select **Create**.
5. Under the **Tools** settings, select **Keys**. Retrieve your Communication Services [Connection String](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#create-azure-communication-services-resource).
6. Under **Primary Key**, copy the **Connection string** value.
   A valid connection string follows the format `endpoint=COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_URL;accesskey=ACCESS_KEY`.

Next, configure your email provider in Auth0:

1. Go to [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
2. Select **Use my own email provider**.
3. Select **Azure Communication Services**.
4. Enter a **From** email address.

   <Warning>
   Azure Communications Services only supports a raw email address (`user@example.com`) in the **From** field. Update the default value (`{{ application.name }} <root@auth0.com>`) to avoid errors.
   </Warning>

5. Add the Azure Communication Services **Connection string**.
6. Select **Save**.

## Send a test email

Send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If the configuration is correct, you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for error codes.

Once configured, the Communication Services [Metrics Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/metrics#chat-api-request-metric-operations) page displays delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
