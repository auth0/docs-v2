<Card title="Before you start">

* You must have a [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365) account with an active subscription.
* Ensure your Microsoft 365 subscription is licensed to send emails through Exchange Online.

  + You need at a minimum a paid subscription to Microsoft Business Basic plan to use the Microsoft Graph API for Exchange Online.
* Emails will be sent from Auth0 to your SMTP provider. Your ports should be open and allow inbound connections from specific Auth0 IP addresses. To learn more, read [Auth0 IP Addresses for Allow Lists](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

  + Update the list of IPs in [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).

</Card>

Auth0 allows you to configure your own SMTP email provider so you can manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications.

<Warning>

Auth0's built-in email infrastructure should be used for testing emails only.

</Warning>

## Configure Microsoft 365

2. Register a [Azure Active Directory Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application) resource if you currently do not have one.
3. Navigate to your Active Directory Application resource. Select **Services > App registrations**, and then select the application you will be using to send emails.
4. Configure the required application permissions by navigating to **Manage > API permissions**.
5. Add the `Mail.Send`[permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application#api-permissions) by selecting **Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions** selector.

   2. Navigate to **Manage > Certificates & secrets** and collect the **Value** to create an application [secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application#certificates--secrets).
   3. Retrieve the organization **User Email** that will send the emails through the application by **Search > Users**. Select **Services > Users**, select your authorized user, and then collect their **User Email** from their properties.
7. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
8. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
9. Click the **Microsoft 365** logo.
