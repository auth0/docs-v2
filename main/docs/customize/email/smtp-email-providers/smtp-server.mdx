You can configure your tenant with SMTP server details from an email provider or mail server you run.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
If we support your email provider directly, we recommend using that integration (instead of SMTP server details) because it supports more secure authentication protocols.
</Callout>

## SMTP server requirements

The SMTP server must:

* Support [SMTP AUTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_Authentication) with the LOGIN protocol.
* Support [TLS 1.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS) or higher.
* Have a certificate signed by a public certificate authority (CA).
* Allow inbound connections from [Auth0 IP addresses](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

## Configure tenants with an SMTP server

You can configure your tenant with an SMTP server using the Auth0 Dashboard or using the Management API.

### Using the Auth0 Dashboard

To configure your tenant with an SMTP server using the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/templates/provider).
2. Enable the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
3. Select **SMTP**.
4. Enter a **From** email address, and then enter your SMTP server's **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, and **Password**.
    We recommend port 587 if available because it is the current default SMTP port and supports TLS. Some providers may require use of the older port 465. We recommend against port 25, the original SMTP port, because it is blocked by many providers and ISPs.
5. Click **Save**.

You can then send a test email by clicking the **Send Test Email** button. If you do not receive a confirmation email after a few minutes, check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for any failures.

### Using the Management API

To configure your tenant with an SMTP server using the Management API, use the `/api/v2/emails/provider` endpoint.

* To configure an email provider for the first time, send a [`POST` request to `/api/v2/emails/provider`](/docs/api/management/v2/emails/post-provider).

* To update an existing email provider, send a [`PATCH` request to `/api/v2/emails/provider`](/docs/api/management/v2/emails/patch-provider). When changing the host, port, or username, you [must supply a password](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations#allow-omitting-password-on-smtp-email-provider-host-related-changes).

## Additional considerations

* In April 2026, Microsoft Exchange Online plans to [retire basic authentication for SMTH AUTH](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/exchange-online-to-retire-basic-auth-for-client-submission-smtp-auth/4114750), which affects the `smtp.office365.com` and `smtp-legacy.office365.com` endpoints. We recommend using our integrations for [Microsoft Office 365 Exchange Online](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-365-exchange-as-smtp-email-provider) and [Azure Communication Services Email](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-azure-comm-service-as-smtp-email-provider).

* If you need support for authentication protocols other than LOGIN, you can [write an Action to connect to your SMTP server](/docs/customize/email/configure-a-custom-email-provider).
