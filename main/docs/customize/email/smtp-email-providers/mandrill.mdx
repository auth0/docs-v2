description: Instructions on how to configure Mandrill as an email provider with Auth0.
---

## Prerequisites

* You must have a [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/signup/) account.

* You must configure your provider to allow inbound connections from specific [Auth0 IP addresses](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

## Configure Mandrill

1. Log in to [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/signup/).
2. Navigate to Mandrill [Settings](https://mandrillapp.com/settings), and click **Add API key**. Copy this key value.
3. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
4. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
5. Click the **Mandrill** logo.
6. Provide a **From** email address and enter the Mandrill **API Key** you previously copied.
7. Click **Save**.

## Send a test email

Send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If the configuration is correct, you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for error codes.

Once configured, the Mandrill [Outbound Activity](https://mandrillapp.com/activity) page displays delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
