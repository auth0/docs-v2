## Prerequisites

* You must have an [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) account.

* You must configure your provider to allow inbound connections from specific [Auth0 IP addresses](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

You can use API or SMTP credentials. To learn more, see Amazon's [Using Credentials With Amazon SES](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-credentials.html).

## Configure Amazon SES with API credentials

1. Log in to your [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) account.
2. [Verify your domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html).
3. [Verify email addresses](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html)
4. [Request production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html?icmpid=docs_ses_console).
5. [Get your AWS access keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/get-aws-keys.html). Copy these keys; you will need to enter these values into Auth0.
6. [Attach a policy with the proper permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html). Attach a policy with the `ses:SendRawEmail` and `ses:SendEmail` permissions, as in this example:

   ```json lines
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ses:SendRawEmail",
                   "ses:SendEmail"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
7. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
8. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
9. Click the **Amazon Web Services** logo.
10. Provide a **From** email address, enter your AWS **Access Key Id** and **Secret Access Key**, select your **Region**.
11. Click **Save**.

## Configure Amazon SES with SMTP credentials

1. Log in to your [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) account.
2. [Verify your domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html).
3. [Request production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html?icmpid=docs_ses_console).
4. [Get your SMTP credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/smtp-credentials.html). Copy the security credentials; you will need to enter these values into Auth0.
5. Navigate to [Dashboard > Emails > Custom Email Providers](https://manage.auth0.com/#/emails/provider).
6. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
7. Click the **SMTP** logo.
8. Provide a **From** email address, then enter your SMTP server **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, and **Password**, and click **Save**. You can use `email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` (using the appropriate region rather than `us-east-1`) for **Host** and `587` for **Port**.

## Send a test email

Send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If the configuration is correct, you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for error codes.

Once configured, the [Amazon SES console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses) displays delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
