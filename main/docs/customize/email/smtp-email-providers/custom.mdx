For more customization in your email provider configuration, you can configure your tenant with an <Tooltip tip="Action: A Node.js function that executes at defined points during the Auth0 runtime." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">Action</Tooltip>.

Instead of using our email provider or SMTP server integrations, you write the code for your Action to deliver messages to your chosen email provider or SMTP server.

This gives you more control over the email delivery process and lets you implement custom logic for your use case, like retrying failures, changing recipients, or creating Organization-specific logic.
