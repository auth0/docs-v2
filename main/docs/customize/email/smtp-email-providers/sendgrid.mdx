## Prerequisites

* You must have a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) account. If you have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can get a free account in the Azure Marketplace.

* You must configure your provider to allow inbound connections from specific [Auth0 IP addresses](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

## Configure SendGrid

1. Log in to your [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) account.
2. Navigate to SendGrid **Settings > API Keys**, and click **Create API Key**.
3. Type a name for your key and select **Restricted Access**.
4. Under **Access Details**, click to expand **Mail Send**.
5. Set the **Mail Send** permission to **Full Access**.
6. Click **Save** and copy the key value.
7. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
8. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
9. Click the **SendGrid** logo.
10. Type a **From** email address, paste the SendGrid **API Key** you copied, and click **Save**.

If you are using [passwordless authentication with email](/docs/authenticate/passwordless#email), the **From** email address value for your <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=passwordless">passwordless</Tooltip> connection must match the **From** email address value you're using for SendGrid.

## Send a test email

Send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If the configuration is correct, you receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for error codes.

Once configured, the SendGrid [Email Activity](https://sendgrid.com/logs/index) page displays delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
