When updating your SMTP email providerâ€™s host, port, or username, you need to provide your SMTP email provider password. To learn more, read [Deprecations and Migrations](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations).

You can configure your own SMTP email provider to manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications, and customize email templates.

When setting up a custom SMTP provider, Auth0 supports Basic Auth. Although as of October 1, 2022, Microsoft only supports "Modern Auth", you can still use Basic Auth for SMTP authentication in your Auth0 configuration. If you are interested in Auth0 supporting "Modern Auth" for Office 365, please [submit a feature request](https://auth0.com/feedback).

## Configure custom SMTP server

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/templates/provider).
2. Enable the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
3. Select **SMTP**.
4. Enter a **From** email address, and then enter your SMTP server's **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, and **Password**. Common ports include 25 and 587. Avoid using port 25 if possible, as many providers have limitations on this port.
5. Click **Save**.

## Test email delivery

You can now send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If you have configured everything correctly, you will receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, please check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for any failures.

SMTP makes it easy to set up test services that allow you to test that your setup is working without spamming your users. To learn more, see [Set Up Test SMTP Servers](/docs/customize/email/configure-test-smtp-email-servers).
