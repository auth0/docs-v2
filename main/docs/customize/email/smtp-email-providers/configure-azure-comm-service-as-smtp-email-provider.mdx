<Card title="Before you start">

* Create a [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account.
* Configure your firewall to accept traffic from Auth0. For more information, read [Auth0 IP Address for Allow List](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

</Card>

You can use Azure Communication Services as an external SMTP email provider for your Auth0 tenant to manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your outgoing messages.

## Create a resource in Microsoft Azure

1. Log in to your [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account.
2. Create a [Communication Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#create-azure-communication-services-resource)resource if you do not have one.
3. Enter "Communication Services" in the search bar.
4. Select **Create**.
5. Under the **Tools** settings, select **Keys**. Retrieve your Communication Services [Connection String](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp#create-azure-communication-services-resource).
6. Under **Primary Key**, copy the **Connection string** value.
   A valid connection string follows the format `endpoint=COMMUNICATION_SERVICES_URL;accesskey=ACCESS_KEY`.

## Configure your email provider in Auth0

1. Go to [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
2. Select **Use my own email provider**.
3. Select **Azure Communication Services**.
4. Enter a **From** email address.

   <Warning>

   Azure Communications Services only supports a raw email address (`user@example.com`) in the **From** field.

   Make sure you update the default value (`{{ application.name }} <root@auth0.com>`) to avoid errors.

   </Warning>
5. Add the Azure Communication Services **Connection string**.
6. Select **Save**.

## Send a test email

Send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If you have configured everything correctly, you will receive a confirmation email.

If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, please check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for error codes. The Communication Services [Metrics Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/metrics#chat-api-request-metric-operations) page will now display delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
