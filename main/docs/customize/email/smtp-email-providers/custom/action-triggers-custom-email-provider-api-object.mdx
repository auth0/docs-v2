title: 'Actions Triggers: custom-email-provider - API Object'
---

The API object for the custom-email-provider Actions trigger includes:

## `api.cache`

Make changes to the cache.

### `api.cache.delete(key)`

Delete a record describing a cached value at the supplied
key if it exists.

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  The key of the cache record to delete.
</ParamField>

### `api.cache.get(key)`

Retrieve a record describing a cached value at the supplied key,
if it exists. If a record is found, the cached value can be found
at the `value` property of the returned object.

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  The key of the record stored in the cache.
</ParamField>

### `api.cache.set(key, value, options)`

Store or update a string value in the cache at the specified key.

Values stored in this cache are scoped to the Trigger in which they
are set. They are subject to the [Actions Cache Limits](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/limitations).

Values stored in this way will have lifetimes of _up to_ the specified
`ttl` or `expires_at` values. If no lifetime is specified, a default of
lifetime of 24 hours will be used. Lifetimes may not exceed the maximum
duration listed at [Actions Cache Limits](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/limitations).

**Important**: This cache is designed for short-lived, ephemeral data. Items may not be
available in later transactions even if they are within their supplied their lifetime.

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  The key of the record to be stored.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="value" type="string" required>
  The value of the record to be stored.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="options" type="cachesetoptions">
  Options for adjusting cache behavior.
  <Expandable title="options properties" defaultOpen>
    <ResponseField name="expires_at" type="number">
      The absolute expiry time in milliseconds since the unix epoch.
      While cached records may be evicted earlier, they will
      never remain beyond the the supplied `expires_at`.
      
      *Note*: This value should not be supplied if a value was also
      provided for `ttl`. If both options are supplied, the
      earlier expiry of the two will be used.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="ttl" type="number">
      The time-to-live value of this cache entry in milliseconds.
      While cached values may be evicted earlier, they will
      never remain beyond the the supplied `ttl`.
      
      *Note*: This value should not be supplied if a value was also
      provided for `expires_at`. If both options are supplied, the
      earlier expiry of the two will be used.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## `api.notification`

Informs if we should consider the notification event as to be retried or to be dropped.
See each of these methods for further details on the actual behaviour.
If several calls are made, only the last one is considered.

### `api.notification.drop(reason)`

When called, the notification event is considered failed without recovery:
We will log an error for this event, but won't be sending it again to the action in the future.
If you need this notification event to be retried, consider calling retry instead.

<ParamField body="reason" type="string">
  this reason will be part of the log entry, this will help you analyze the error further. Please note that this field is limited to 1024 characters and will be truncated if larger.
</ParamField>

### `api.notification.retry(reason)`

When called, the notification event is considered failed, but recoverable:
We will log an error for this event, but we will retry it up to 5 times in the next minutes.
If you consider that this notification event should not be retried, consider calling drop instead.

<ParamField body="reason" type="string">
  this reason will be part of the log entry, this will help you analyze the error further. Please note that this field is limited to 1024 characters and will be truncated if larger.
</ParamField>
