One way to manage sign-ups for an Auth0 application is with user invitations.

In a typical user invitation workflow, an administrator creates a new user account and then sends an email invitation to a user with an activation link. When the user follows the link, they set a password for the account, and can then log in.

A user invitation system can be useful for use cases like restricting sign-ups or creating accounts in bulk.

## User Invitation Implementations on Auth0

On Auth0, you can implement user invitations using the password change workflow:

* By styling the Universal Login or Classic Login password reset page to additionally support a user invitation experience, you can use a password reset link as an invitation to a new user account.

* By setting a user metadata property when you create the new user account, you can similarly customize the password reset email to additionally support a user invitation experience.

This implementation uses Auth0's password reset flow, so we automatically generate the password reset link and use your tenant's [configured SMTP provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers) to send the invitation email.

If you already have an external email solution and don't want to configure an SMTP provider on your tenant, you can [use the Management API to generate the password change ticket](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tickets/post-password-change) and email the ticket link to the user yourself instead of using Auth0's email template and workflow.

## 1. Create a new Auth0 database user and metadata property

First, [create a new Auth0 database user from the dashboard](/docs/authenticate/database-connections) or the [Create a User endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/#!/Users/post_users) in the Management API and:

* Set the `user.email_verified` parameter set to `false`.

* Create a `user.app_metadata` parameter to indicate that the user has an outstanding invitation. For example, set `user.app_metadata.needsInvitation` to `true`.

Once the user logs in for the first time, they no longer need an invitation and should receive the password change experience in the future. To handle this, [create a post-login Action](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger) that sets `user.app_metadata.needsInvitation` to `false` using `api.user.setAppMetadata`.

## 2. Customize the password change email template

Next, [customize the password change (link) email template](/docs/customize/email/email-templates/customize-email-templates) to handle both user invitation and password change workflows.

[Use Liquid](/docs/customize/email/email-templates/supported-liquid-syntax) to check whether the user metadata property for an outstanding invitation is set and send the appropriate message. For example:

```liquid lines
{% if user.app_metadata.needsInvitation %}
    // User invitation email content here
{% else %}
    // Password change email content here
{% endif %}
```

Additionally, append a query parameter to the password reset link in the message body to indicate which experience the user should see on the password reset page. For example, you can append `type=invite` or `type=reset`.

## 3. Style the password reset page

Based on the query parameter you set in the template, style the password reset page to support both user invitation and password change workflows based on the query parameter.

To control where the user is redirected after setting their password:

* For Universal Login, [customize the password reset flow login route](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/configure-default-login-routes#complete-password-reset-flow).

* For Classic Login, set the **Redirect To** field in the email template.
