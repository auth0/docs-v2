Unlike other email templates, this email template is not configured from the Email Templates section. Instead, it is part of the [settings for the Email Passwordless Connection](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/passwordless).

The <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> Email is sent when a passwordless access is requested, either by code (the user receives a code that types in the application) or by a link (the user clicks on a link and is taken directly to the application).

In the Passwordless Email template, only the `email` property of the `user` object is available.
