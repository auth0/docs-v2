sidebarTitle: User Invitation
---

If you enable the **User Invitation** template, this email is sent when a user is invited to an organization or application.

If a user is invited to become a member of an [Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations/organizations-overview), they will receive a **User Invitation** email that contains a URL link. When the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to your default login route. To learn more, see [Configure Default Login Routes](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/configure-default-login-routes).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
When the user accepts an invitation, the `email_verified` flag is set in the user's profile.

If the user accepts an invitation through federated login, then the identity provider must return the email address that matches the email address to which the invitation was sent. The email verification is not be overridden with the value returned by the identity provider on subsequent logins.

If the user does not accept an invitation before it expires, the invitation will be marked as expired and eventually deleted from the [Auth0 Dashboard](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/dashboard).
