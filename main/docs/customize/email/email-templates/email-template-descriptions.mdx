## Verification link email

If you enable the **Verification Email (Link)** template, this email is sent when a user sign up on a database connection. The message prompts them to confirm their email address by clicking on the included URL.

When the user follows the verification link, the `email_verified` flag is set in the user's profile.

## Verification code email

If you enable the **Verification Email (Code)** template, this email is sent in the following scenarios where the user needs to prove they have access to the email on file for an account:

* You have enabled the code-based email verification flow and a user signs up or logs into the account for the first time

* You have enabled the Adaptive MFA policy and there is a low-confidence transaction for which account ownership must be verified

The email includes a code that users need to enter during the authentication.

## Welcome email

If you enable the **Welcome Email** template, this email is sent when the user verifies their email address.

If you disable the **Welcome Email** template, this email is sent when the user signs up or logs in for the first time.

## MFA enrollment email

If you enable the **Enroll in Multifactor Authentication** template, this email is sent when an admin sends an [Auth0 Guardian](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/auth0-guardian) enrollment email.

This email will be generated when an <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> enrollment invitation is sent. The message will contain a link that, when visited, will show the MFA enrollment experience.

In addition to the common variables available for all email templates, the `link` variable is available in this email type, containing the URL that you will use to construct the link for this action, as in this example:

`<a href="/docs/{{ link }}">Enroll your MFA device</a>`

Unlike other email templates, the correct variable name is `link` and not `url`. Also, the `connection.name` variable is not available on this email template type.

* Multiple Custom Domain (MCD) information:

  + `custom_domain.domain`
  + `custom_domain.domain_metadata`

## Change password link email

If you enable the **Change Password (Link)** template, this email is sent when a user requests a password change.

The email contains a link that brings the user to the [password reset page](/docs/customize/login-pages/classic-login/customize-password-reset-page). The password is not changed until the user follows the link and enters a new password.

## Change password code email

If you enable the **Change Password (Code)** template, this email is sent when a user requests a password change.

The email contains a link that brings the user to the [password reset page](/docs/customize/login-pages/classic-login/customize-password-reset-page). The password is not changed until the user follows the link and enters uses the code.

## Blocked account email

If you enable the **Blocked Account Email** template, this email is sent when access to an account from a specific IP address is blocked by [brute-force protection](/docs/secure/attach-protection/brute-force-protection).

The message contains a link to re-enable the origin of the request.

## Password breach alert email

If you enable [breached password detection](/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection) and the **Password Breach Alert** template, this email is sent when Auth0 detects that a user is trying to access the application using a password that has been leaked by a third party.

## MFA verification code email

If you enable the **Verification Code for Email MFA** template, this email is sent when a user using an MFA email verifier requires a verification code.

## User invitation email

If you enable the **User Invitation** template, this email is sent when a user is invited to an organization or application.

If a user is invited to become a member of an [Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations/organizations-overview), they will receive a **User Invitation** email that contains a URL link. When the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to your default login route. To learn more, see [Configure Default Login Routes](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/configure-default-login-routes).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

When the user accepts an invitation, the `email_verified` flag is set in the user's profile.

If the user accepts an invitation through federated login, then the identity provider must return the email address that matches the email address to which the invitation was sent. The email verification is not be overridden with the value returned by the identity provider on subsequent logins.

If the user does not accept an invitation before it expires, the invitation will be marked as expired and eventually deleted from the [Auth0 Dashboard](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/dashboard).

## Passwordless OTP email

Unlike the previous email templates types, this email template is not configured from the Email Templates section. Instead, it's 

is part of the [settings for the Email Passwordless Connection](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/passwordless).

The <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> Email is sent when a passwordless access is requested, either by code (the user receives a code that types in the application) or by a link (the user clicks on a link and is taken directly to the application).

https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/email-otp

In the Passwordless Email template, only the `email` property of the `user` object is available.
