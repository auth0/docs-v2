You can access the email template variables in the **From Address**, **Subject**, and **Message** fields.

Variables are referenced using the `{{ variable_name }}` syntax in Liquid. For example: `Hello {{ user.name }}. Welcome to {{ application.name }} from {{ friendly_name }}.`

## Common Variables

The following variables are available to all templates (except where noted).

* The `application` object, with access to the standard client properties like
  + `application.name`
  + `application.clientID`
  + `application.metadata`

* `connection.name` (except in the **Multi-factor Enrollment Email**)

* `request_language` language selection for users

* The `user` object, with access to the following properties (The attributes available for the `user` object will depend on the type of connection being used. Individual email templates define additional variables that are appropriate for the specific template):
  + `user.email`
  + `user.email_verified`
  + `user.picture`
  + `user.nickname`
  + `user.given_name`
  + `user.family_name`
  + `user.name`
  + `user.app_metadata`, which stores information (such as a user's support plan, security roles, or access control groups) that can impact a user's core functionality, such as how an application functions or what the user can access.
  + `user.user_metadata`, which stores user attributes (such as user preferences) that do not impact a user's core functionality.

* Tenant-related information (defined in [Tenant Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant)):
  + `tenant`, which is the raw tenant name
  + `friendly_name`
  + `support_email`
  + `support_url`

* Multiple <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domains">custom domains</Tooltip> information:
  + `custom_domain.domain` - the tenant's domain name
  + `custom_domain.domain_metadata` - provides access to the custom domain's metadata fields (key-value pairs)

The following user properties are untrusted and must be piped through Liquid’s `escape` function (`{{ user.name | escape }}`):

* user.picture
* user.nickname
* user.given_name
* user.family_name
* user.name

In addition, any `user.user_metadata` properties that may contain user-provided information must be escaped.

## Organization variables

When a user logs in through an [Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations/organizations-overview), the following additional variables are available:

* `organization.id`
* `organization.display_name`
* `organization.name`
* `organization.metadata`
* `organization.branding.logo_url`
* `organization.branding.colors.primary`
* `organization.branding.colors.page_background`

## Redirect To variables

For those emails where the user needs to follow a link to take action, you can also configure the **URL Lifetime** and **Redirect To** URL destination after the action is completed. Liquid Syntax is also supported in the **Redirect To** URL field, but only three variables are supported:

* `application.name`
* `application.clientID`
* `application.callback_domain`
