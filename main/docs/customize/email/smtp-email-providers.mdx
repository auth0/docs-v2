Auth0's email-based workflows handle when emails are sent and what the emails contain. To actually deliver the outgoing mail, you need an SMTP server or service from an external email provider.

Your tenant's built-in SMTP email provider is limited and not supported for production use. Configuring your tenant with an external SMTP email provider routes all emails through that provider instead.

Using an external SMTP email provider also removes the [limits of the built-in provider](/docs/customize/email#built-in-smtp-email-provider) so, for example, you can customize [email templates](/docs/customize/email/email-templates) or write email-based <Tooltip tip="Action: A Node.js function that executes at defined points during the Auth0 runtime." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">Actions</Tooltip>.

You can configure one email provider which is used for all emails sent from your tenant.

## Configure a Supported External SMTP Email Provider

We integrate natively with some SMTP email providers, which means you can configure your tenant by adding API credentials from your provider.

We support the following providers:

* [Amazon SES](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/amazon-ses)
* [Azure Communication Services](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/azure-communication-services)
* [Mandrill](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/mandrill)
* [Microsoft 365 Exchange Online](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/microsoft-365-exchange-online)
* [SendGrid](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/sendgrid)
* [SparkPost](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/sparkpost)
* [Mailgun](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/mandrill)

## Configure with SMTP Server Details

You can also configure your tenant by [adding SMTP server details](/docs/customize/email/configure-custom-smtp-email-provider) directly. This is a good option if:

* We don't integrate natively with your chosen email provider.

* You want to set up a dummy SMTP server (like [Debug Mail](https://debugmail.io/), [FakeSMTP](https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/), or [smtp4dev](https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev)) for testing.

* You run your own mail server.

We don't allow certain false domains commonly used during testing. Use real email addresses to avoid disruption or errors.
