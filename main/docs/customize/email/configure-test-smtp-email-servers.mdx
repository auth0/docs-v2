While working in your development or testing environment, we recommend that you use a test SMTP server so that you can:

* Check for successful email deliveries.
* View how emails you sent appear to recipients prior to go live.

You can either set up your own SMTP server or use a third-party service. Once you have either your own SMTP server set up or a test service available, you provide its credentials the way you typically would for a [third-party email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-custom-external-smtp-email-provider).

Auth0 does not allow certain "false" domains commonly used during testing. Use real email addresses to avoid disruption or errors.

Here are some third-party email testing services you can use:

* [Debug Mail](https://debugmail.io/)
* [FakeSMTP](https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/)
* [Haraka](https://haraka.github.io/)
* [MailTrap](https://mailtrap.io/)
* [smtp4dev](https://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/)
