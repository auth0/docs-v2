When Auth0 sends an email to notify a user that their account has been blocked due to suspicious activity, the message contains a link to re-enable the origin of the request.

The email sent to the user reads something like:

`Blocked Access Attempt`

`We detected suspicious activity from the ip: 123.23.123.23 from Buenos Aires, Argentina. If that is not your IP address, click here to unblock it. Otherwise disregard this email. Clarification: Your account is not blocked, only access to it from the aforementioned IP.`

`Thanks,`

`Default App`

To customize the template used for this message, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Dashboard > Branding > Email Templates](https://manage.auth0.com/#/templates).
2. From the **Template** dropdown, select **Blocked Account Email**.
3. Make the desired changes. To learn more, read [Customize Email Templates](/docs/customize/email/email-templates).
4. To test, click **Try,** enter a valid email address that you have access to view, and choose the correct connection type.
5. Click **Cancel**, returning to the email template page. You can make any changes and try again, then select **Save** when you are satisfied with the results.
