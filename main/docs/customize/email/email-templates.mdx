description: Enable and customize emails used in Auth0 workflows with email templates.
---

Emails used in Auth0 workflows (like user registration verification, breached password alerts, and MFA enrollment) each have an email template which generates the email.

Email templates let you customize the email's from address, subject, message body, and more. Most fields support [Liquid](#about-liquid) for dynamic customization.

You can enable, disable, and customize email templates on the [email templates page of the dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/templates).

## About Liquid

[Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/index.html) is an open-source templating language that extends the functionality of HTML. It can:

* Dynamically populate variables with data (for example, replacing `{{ user.name }}` with the user's name)
* Implement logic (like `if`/`else` statements)
* Modify data with filters for string and array manipulation, math operators, and more

You can use Liquid syntax along with the `user_metadata.lang` property from the user object to alter the content based on the user preferred language. For example, you can [use an action](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview) to set the `user_metadata.lang` property to `it` for Italian. You must set the language property with an action or otherwise.

## Limits

* Email template customization is not available when using the built-in testing SMTP server. To use email templates, [configure an external SMTP email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers).

* You can only use one template for each type of email, but Liquid lets you implement conditionals and other logic for use cases like multilingual emails.

* Email templates do not support plain text emails. All emails must be HTML.

* For security purposes, **From Address**es may not contain `@auth0.com`. If you enter an `@auth0.com` email address in From Addresses, your tenant sends only default emails, ignoring any customization. Private Cloud users may configure a similar domain DenyList.
