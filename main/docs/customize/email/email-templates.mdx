description: Enable and customize emails used in Auth0 workflows with email templates.
---

Emails used in Auth0 workflows each have a corresponding email template which determines the email's from address, subject, message body, and more.

You can enable, disable, and customize email templates on the [email templates page of the dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/templates).

Content fields in email templates support [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/index.html), an open-source templating language that extends the functionality of HTML. Liquid lets you:

* Dynamically populate variables with data, like replacing `{{ user.name }}` with the user's name
* Implement logic, like `if`/`else` statements
* Modify data with filters for string and array manipulation, math operators, and more

## Email template limits

* Email template customization is not available when using the built-in testing SMTP server. To use email templates, [configure an external SMTP email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers).

* You can only use one template for each type of email, but Liquid lets you implement conditionals and other logic for use cases like multilingual emails.

* Email templates do not support plain text emails. All emails must be HTML.

* For security purposes, **From Address**es may not contain `@auth0.com`. If you enter an `@auth0.com` email address in From Addresses, your tenant sends only default emails, ignoring any customization. Private Cloud users may configure a similar domain DenyList.
