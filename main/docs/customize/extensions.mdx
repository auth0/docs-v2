<Warning>

We plan to deprecate Rules and Hooks in 2024, and at that time, Rules and Hooks-based Extensions will be out of support. We highly recommend that you migrate to Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience.

To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life.](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/)

</Warning>

Auth0 Extensions allow you to install applications or run commands/scripts that extend the functionality of the Auth0 base product. Each extension is separate from all other extensions and is subject to Auth0's [Rate Limit Policy](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy). Auth0 defines extensions per tenant, so data is stored by the pair `tenant\extension`.

To implement and manage extensions on your Auth0 Dashboard, you must have the Admin role.
