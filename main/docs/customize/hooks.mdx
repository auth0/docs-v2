<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

<Warning>

Because we plan to remove Rules and Hooks functions in 2026, you should create new Rules or Hooks only in your Development environment and only to test migration to Actions.

To learn how to migrate your Rules to Actions, read [Migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions). To learn how to migrate your Hooks to Actions, read [Migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions).

If you are behind a firewall, for this feature to work properly you may need to add the appropriate Auth0 IP addresses to the Allow List. To learn more, read [Auth0 IP Addresses for Allow Lists](/docs/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist).

Hooks are secure, self-contained functions that allow you to customize the behavior of Auth0 when executed for selected extensibility points of the Auth0 platform. Auth0 invokes hooks during runtime to execute your custom Node.js code.

Whether hooks can be used with connections varies according to extensibility point. Hooks that can be used with connections only work with database and <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=passwordless">passwordless</Tooltip> connections and are subject to Auth0's [Rate Limit Policy](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy). To learn more, read [Database Connections](/docs/authenticate/database-connections) and [Passwordless Connections](/docs/authenticate/passwordless).
