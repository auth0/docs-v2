Auth0 offers several email-based features, like [user account verification emails](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/verify-emails) and [breached password detection emails](/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection).

Every tenant has access to a built-in SMTP server that you can use to check for successful email delivery and preview how emails appear. The built-in SMTP server is meant for development and testing only. Learn more about the [limits of the built-in SMTP server]().

To use email features in production, you need to configure your tenant with [your own SMTP provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers). When you do, all emails are routed through your chosen email service. Additionally, you can then:

* Customize the appearance and content of emails using [email templates with Liquid](/docs/customize/email/email-templates), an open-source template language

* Control the full email delivery process using the Management API, like retrying failures, changing recipients or message payloads, and creating Organization-specific logic

A paid subscription plan is required for email customization. To learn more, read [Auth0 Pricing Page](https://auth0.com/pricing).

Auth0's built-in email provider is **not supported for use in a production environment**, should only be used for testing, and has several restrictions:

* You will not be able to use any of the email customization features. The content of the emails sent for testing will be restricted to the format of the existing templates.
* All emails will be sent from a predefined **from address** (`no-reply@auth0user.net`).
* You will be restricted to sending no more than 10 emails per minute, regardless of email type.
* Your ability to send email from your tenant may be reduced (or even temporarily blocked) if your emails result in high bounce rates.

To remove these restrictions, you must set up your own email provider. Some options are:

* [Configure External SMTP Email Providers](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers)
* [Configure Custom External SMTP Email Providers](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-custom-external-smtp-email-provider)
* [Customize Email Handling](/docs/customize/email/manage-email-flow)

After you have configured your own email service provider, go to [Dashboard > Branding > Email Templates](https://manage.auth0.com/#/emails) to [customize your emails](/docs/customize/email/email-templates).

If you have an Auth0 database connection, there are several email templates you can use as part of the authentication flow:

* Verification emails (using link or code)
* Welcome emails
* Enroll in <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> emails
* Change password emails
* Blocked account emails
* Password breach alert emails

You can restrict user signups to an application with user invitations as a provisioning workflow, either in conjunction with or as an alternative to self-provisioning.
