Auth0 offers several email-based workflows, like [user account verification](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/verify-emails) and [breached password detection](/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection).

To send emails on Auth0, you can:

* **Use the [built-in SMTP email provider](#built-in-smtp-email-provider) during development** to check email delivery and preview how emails appear during testing.

* **Configure an [external SMTP email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers) for production** by adding credentials from a supported provider (like your Mandrill API key or Amazon SES access keys) or SMTP server details to your tenant.

To manage and customize emails on Auth0, you can:

* **Modify the appearance and content** of emails using [email templates](/docs/customize/email/email-templates) and Liquid, an open-source template language.

* **Fully control the email delivery process** by writing an <Tooltip tip="Action: A Node.js function that executes at defined points during the Auth0 runtime." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">Action</Tooltip> that sends requests to your email provider's API and implements custom logic for your use case.

* **Trigger emails or create tickets with the Management API** to send emails or generate URLs (like for password resets or email verification) outside of the default workflows.

You can restrict user signups to an application with user invitations as a provisioning workflow, either in conjunction with or as an alternative to self-provisioning.

## About SMTP Email Providers

Auth0's email-based workflows handle when emails are sent and what the emails contain. To actually deliver the outgoing mail, you need an SMTP server or service from an external email provider.

### External SMTP Email Providers

We integrate natively with a number of SMTP email providers, which means you can configure your tenant by adding your API credentials from your provider.

For other providers (or for a mail server you run yourself), you can configure your tenant by adding the SMTP server details directly.

### Built-In SMTP Email Provider

During development, you can use your tenant's built-in SMTP email provider. It's available by default and requires no configuration.

However, the built-in SMTP email provider does not support production use and has the following limits:

* You cannot use custom email templates.

* You cannot customize the **From Address** All emails are sent from `no-reply@auth0user.net`.

* You are limited to sending 10 emails per minute, regardless of email type.

* If your emails have a high bounce rate, we may reduce or temporarily block the ability to send email from your tenant.

To remove these limits and use emails in production, set up a [third-party SMTP email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers).
