Auth0 offers several email-based workflows, like [user account verification](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/verify-emails) and [breached password detection](/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection). To send emails as part of these workflows, you can:

* **Use the [built-in SMTP email provider](#built-in-smtp-email-provider) during development** to check email delivery and preview how emails appear during testing.

* **Configure an [external SMTP email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers) for production** by adding credentials from a supported provider (like your Mandrill API key or Amazon SES access keys) or SMTP server details to your tenant.

To manage and customize emails, you need to configure an external SMTP email provider. Once you do, you can:

* **Modify the appearance and content** of emails using [email templates](/docs/customize/email/email-templates) and Liquid, an open-source template language.

* **Fully control the email delivery process** by writing an <Tooltip tip="Action: A Node.js function that executes at defined points during the Auth0 runtime." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">Action</Tooltip> that sends requests to your email provider's API and implements custom logic for your use case.

* **Trigger emails or create tickets with the Management API** to send emails or generate URLs (like for password resets or email verification) outside of the default workflows.
