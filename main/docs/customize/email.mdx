description: Manage and customize emails sent by Auth0, including account verification, welcome messages, and breached password detection.
---

Auth0 offers several email-based workflows, like [user account verification](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/verify-emails) and [breached password detection](/docs/secure/attack-protection/breached-password-detection).

To use these workflows, start by configuring an [external SMTP email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers) using credentials from a supported provider (like your Mandrill API key or Amazon SES access keys) or SMTP server details.

To manage and customize emails further, you can:

* **Modify the appearance and content** of emails using [email templates](/docs/customize/email/email-templates) and Liquid, an open-source template language.

* **Fully control the email delivery process** by writing an <Tooltip tip="Action: A Node.js function that executes at defined points during the Auth0 runtime." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Actions">Action</Tooltip> that sends requests to your email provider's API and implements custom logic for your use case.

* **Trigger emails or create tickets outside the default workflows** using the Management API.

During development, you can use our [built-in email provider](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers#use-the-built-in-smtp-email-provider-for-development) to check email delivery and preview how emails appear during testing.
