At Auth0, we consider **extensibility** to be one of our essential product capabilities. But while our endless options for integration are an excellent way to customize your own unique solution, it can sometimes be difficult and time-consuming for our customers to figure out how to implement them. Enter the [Auth0 Marketplace](https://marketplace.auth0.com/).

We built the Marketplace as a way to connect our customers with service providers and builders who implement these types of integrations regularly. Listing your integration with Auth0 promotes your company with our customers who are looking to do more with their authentication pipeline.

## Plan your integration

Each integration you build should have a clear and well-explained use case solving a specific customer problem. If multiple customer problems can be solved with integrations between Auth0 and your service, we can list multiple integrations.

Use the pages below to learn more about integrating with Auth0.

#### Defining your Integration Use Case

Our customers need to understand what problem your integration will solve and how it will go about solving it.

## Build your integration

Integrations with Auth0 are built on one or more of our extensibility points. [Sign up for a free Auth0 tenant](https://auth0.com/signup), and use our documentation to get your service working with Auth0 and learn how to get listed in our Marketplace.

We have specific guidance for our most common integrations below. Please contact our partner account team using the link at the bottom of this page if you need an example that's not listed here.

#### Actions

Actions Integrations are closed-source, self-contained functions written in JavaScript that execute at specific points in the Auth0 platform.

Social Connection Integrations are OAuth2 sources of identity that provide a profile to Auth0 after a user successfully logs in.
