<Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=SSO">SSO</Tooltip> (single sign-on) integrations use an Auth0 identity to log in, via <Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=SAML">SAML</Tooltip>, to an external service. This allows customers with internal applications to use SSO to access third-party vendors using the Auth0 identity.

The [SSO integrations available on Marketplace](https://marketplace.auth0.com/features/sso-integrations) define both the standard SAML configuration values needed to connect Auth0 to external vendors, and the fields necessary for additional customer-specific values. In these integrations, Auth0 acts as the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> in a service provider (SP)-initiated scenario. To learn how to configure Auth0 for these integrations, see [Configure Auth0 as a SAML Identity Provider](/docs/authenticate/single-sign-on/outbound-single-sign-on/configure-auth0-saml-identity-provider).

The part that our partners will provide is the default SAML configuration to make this transaction work. This will consist of values or customer-requested fields for some or all of the attributes listed in [Customize SAML Assertions: SAML Assertion Attributes](/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-configuration/customize-saml-assertions).

To build and test an integration, [create a tenant](https://auth0.com/signup) in Auth0 and follow the documentation above to create a working SSO integration with your service.

In addition, to assist you in building your integration you can leverage our [SSO Integration](https://github.com/auth0-marketplace/TEMPLATE-sso).

## Submit your SSO Integration

If you are ready to become a partner and submit your integration, please create a partner account at the [partner portal](https://partners.marketplace.auth0.com/) and do the following:

1. Complete the partner profile which includes a short description about your business, legal and marketing content, company logo, terms of service, privacy policy, contact info, and support email.
2. Submit your integration which includes integration code, installation guide and details such as name and description. Optionally, you can add 3 value propositions to your integration.

**We will need the following configuration and documentation:**

* The JSON used to configure the working SAML add-on Application
* A list of fields that should be shown to the customer configuring the integration (like **Callback URL**, **<Tooltip tip="Audience: Unique identifier of the audience for an issued token. Named aud in a token, its value contains the ID of either an application (Client ID) for an ID Token or an API (API Identifier) for an Access Token." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Audience">Audience</Tooltip>**, and **Signing Certificate**)
* An installation guide written in Markdown.
