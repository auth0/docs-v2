Partners like you use Actions Integrations to build zero-code solutions that tie their products into Auth0 workflows. Actions Integrations let Auth0 customers implement solutions like identity verification or consent management without writing any code. You write the Actions Integration; customers drag and drop it into their workflow.

Actions Integrations are self-contained functions that execute at chosen points in the Auth0 platform. Written in JavaScript, they are closed source; customers can’t modify the code.

## Create and publish an Actions Integration

Creating an Actions Integration involves planning, building, and testing. Before you make it available to customers in the [Auth0 Marketplace](https://marketplace.auth0.com/), Auth0 reviews the Actions Integration. For information about the Auth0 Marketplace, read [Marketplace Partners](/docs/customize/integrations/marketplace-partners).

### Step 1. Determine your use case

Identify what use case your Actions Integration will address. What problem will it solve for customers? How will it solve the problem? For more information, read [Defining an Integration Use Case](/docs/customize/integrations/marketplace-partners/defining-an-integration-use-case).

### Step 2. Choose a flow

Action Integrations consist of a single [Action](/docs/customize/actions). What an Action can do is determined by where it is executed within the Auth0 runtime environment, its Action  [flow](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers). Available Action flows are:

* **Login flow** runs synchronously after a user successfully signs up or logs in. Login events include interactive flows (like username/password or federated login) and non-interactive flows (like session checks and <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=refresh+token">refresh token</Tooltip> exchanges). To learn more about this flow, read [Login Flow](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger).
* **Machine to Machine flow** runs synchronously when an application requests an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip> using the client credentials grant. To learn more about this flow, read [Machine to Machine Flow](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/machine-to-machine-trigger).
* **Pre User Registration flow** runs synchronously before Auth0 adds a user to a database or <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=passwordless">passwordless</Tooltip> connection. This flow does not run for federated logins like enterprise or social connections. To learn more about this flow, read [Pre User Registration Flow](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/pre-user-registration-trigger).
* **Post User Registration flow** runs asynchronously after Auth0 adds a user to a database or passwordless connection. This flow does not run for federated logins like enterprise or social connections. To learn more about this flow, read [Post User Registration Flow](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/post-user-registration-trigger).
* **Post Change Password flow** runs asynchronously after the customer changes a password for a database connection user. This flow does not run for password changes on other types of connections. To learn more about this flow, read [Post Change Password Flow](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/password-reset-triggers/post-change-password-trigger).
* **Send Phone Message** **flow** delivers a phone or SMS message as part of a custom <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> provider. To learn about custom MFA providers, read [Customize Multi-factor Authentication SMS and Voice Messages](/docs/customize/customize-sms-or-voice-messages). To learn more about this flow, read [Send Phone Message Flow](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/mfa-notifications-trigger).

To learn more about Action flows, read [Explore Flows and Triggers](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers). If you need to redirect users to an endpoint during login, read [Redirect Actions for Partners](/docs/customize/integrations/marketplace-partners/redirect-actions-for-partners).

## Step 3. Build an Actions Integration

Once you’ve decided which flow fits your Action Integration's use case, build your Action in a testing tenant. For instructions, read [Write Your First Action](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action). This Action will be the basis for your Action Integration code.

In addition, to assist you in building your integration you can leverage our Action integration templates:

* [Post Login Action Integration Template](https://github.com/auth0-marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-post-login)
* [Machine-to-Machine Action Integration Template](https://github.com/auth0-marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-client-credentials)
* [Pre User Registration Action Integration Template](https://github.com/auth0-marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-pre-user-registration)
* [Post User Registration Action Integration Template](https://github.com/auth0-marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-post-user-registration)
* [Post Change Password Action Integration Template](https://github.com/auth0-marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-post-password-change)
* [Send Phone Message Action Integration Template](https://github.com/auth0-marketplace/TEMPLATE-action-phone-message)

To learn how to make your Actions Integration secure and stable, read [Actions Coding Guidelines](/docs/customize/actions/action-coding-guidelines). Also follow these guidelines specific to Actions Integrations:

* When building your Action in a test tenant, use secrets for all values that a customer needs to provide (such as identifiers, tenant names, and thresholds). When you submit your Actions Integration, Auth0 asks which fields must be encrypted at rest (remain secrets) and which can be editable text fields.
* Use a debug/test mode configuration flag for logging that helps with setup or troubleshooting. Actions Integrations should rarely output logs for all executions.
* Write secret names in `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE` to ease review.
* Action Integrations are closed source; customers can neither see nor modify the code. Any customer-specific input required to control the Action Integration must come from secrets or configuration.

### Step 4. Test your Actions Integrations

Because Auth0 reviewers don't have access to your service, you must test your Action before submitting it for review. Manually test both successful executions and edge cases. Include these checks:

* Does the Action fail silently or block further execution?
* How does the Action work if an HTTP request fails?
* What, if any, error messages are exposed to users?
* What information is logged?
* Can the Action be bypassed or spoofed?

During the submission process, Auth0 asks for unit test coverage for the success path. Auth0 provides all the tooling and examples needed to make this as simple as possible.

### Step 5. Submit your Actions Integration

Once you have written and thoroughly tested your Actions Integration, submit it to Auth0 for review: submit an [Auth0 Marketplace service request](https://autheco.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/1/create/43). After a successful initial review, the integration is reviewed for security compliance.

### Step 6. Publish your Actions Integration

Once Auth0 completes the reviews of your Actions Integration, we will notify you if the integration has passed the reviews and publication timelines.
