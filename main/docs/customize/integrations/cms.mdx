Auth0 provides Content Management System Plugins/Extensions to integrate your CMS installation with your Auth0 account. These plugins enable <Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Single+Sign-on">Single Sign-on</Tooltip> (SSO) for Enterprises, social login and user/password login through all your instances and platforms.

Login features are implemented through a new Login Widget (powered by Auth0) that enables:
