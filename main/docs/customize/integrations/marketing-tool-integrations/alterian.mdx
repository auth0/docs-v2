In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to export user data in Auth0 to a CSV file then import it into Alterian with the campaign manager's data import tool.

## Create a user data file

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Alterian accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

At the top in the **Fields** section, provide a **User Field** and **Column Name** for each user attribute to include in the export. For example:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>User Field</th>
<th>Column Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>email</code></td>
<td>Email Address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>created_at</code></td>
<td>Created At</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>given_name</code></td>
<td>First Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>family_name</code></td>
<td>Last Name</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

After adding the user fields, click on the **Export Users** button to start the export. Once the export is complete, download the CSV file to use in the following section.
