In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to export user data in Auth0 to a CSV file then import it into the [MailChimp dashboard](https://login.mailchimp.com/).

## Create a user data file

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. MailChimp accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

To learn more, review [MailChimp Knowledge Base: Format Guidelines for Your Import File](https://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/format-guidelines-for-your-import-file).

At the top in the **Fields** section, provide a **User Field** and **Column Name** for each user attribute to include in the export. For MailChimp, an email field with the column name `Email Address` is required, so make sure to include it. For example:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>User Field</th>
<th>Column Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>email</code></td>
<td>Email Address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>created_at</code></td>
<td>Created At</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>given_name</code></td>
<td>First Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>family_name</code></td>
<td>Last Name</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

After adding the user fields, click on the **Export Users** button to start the export. Once the export is complete, download the CSV file to use in the following section.

## Import a user data file

Before you get started, you can find more information by visiting [MailChimp Knowledge Base: Import Subscribers to a List](https://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/import-subscribers-to-a-list).

Log in to your MailChimp account and go to the **Lists** page. Select a list to import your Auth0 users into ([or create a new list](https://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/create-a-new-list)).

1. On your MailChimp List page, click on **Import Contacts** from the **Add Contacts** menu.
2. Select the `CSV or tab-delimited text file` option to import contacts from.
3. Upload the user data CSV file you exported from Auth0 in the previous section. MailChimp will interpret your user data on the following page.
4. Check that the column names and field types are correct.
5. Click the **Next** button.
6. Review your selections and set the import category.
7. Click the **Import** button to start the user import.

That's it! You successfully imported your Auth0 users into MailChimp.
