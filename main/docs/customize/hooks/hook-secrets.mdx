<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

</Warning>

<Warning>

Because we plan to remove Rules and Hooks functions in 2026, you should create new Rules or Hooks only in your Development environment and only to test migration to Actions.

To learn how to migrate your Rules to Actions, read [Migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions). To learn how to migrate your Hooks to Actions, read [Migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions).

</Warning>

Hooks feature integrated secret management to securely store secrets while making them conveniently available in code.

To access a configured Hook Secret from within a hook, use `context.webtask.secrets.SECRET_NAME`.
