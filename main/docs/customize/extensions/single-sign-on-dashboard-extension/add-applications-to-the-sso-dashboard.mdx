## Prerequisites

* [Install the SSO Dashboard Extension](/docs/customize/extensions/single-sign-on-dashboard-extension/install-sso-dashboard-extension).

## Add applications

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions), and select your new SSO Dashboard extension.
   If you are an administrator, you can also log in to the SSO Dashboard using `https://{yourTenant}.<REGION>8.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/admins/login`.
2. In the upper right corner, select **Settings** from the dropdown below your tenant name.
3. Click **Create App** to add a new application.

   The **New Application** form appears.
4. Complete the following fields for the new application:

   <table class="table"><thead>
   <tr>
   <th>Field</th>
   <th>Description</th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Type</strong></td>
   <td>A dropdown where you select SAML, OpenID-Connect, or WS-Federation depending on the type of application.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Application</strong></td>
   <td>A dropdown where you select the application that you wish to add.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Name</strong></td>

   </tr>

   <td>(<em>Optional</em>) The connection type. You can add or edit your available connection types in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database">Connections section of the Auth0 Management dashboard</a>.  If a connection is not set and the user is not logged, the user will see the Auth0 Login page.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Custom URL</strong></td>
   <td>(<em>Optional</em>) Checkbox to use a custom URL rather than the Auth0 URL. If you check the box, a field appears where you can enter your custom URL.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Enabled</strong></td>
   <td>Checkbox for this application to be visible (published) to your users.</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
