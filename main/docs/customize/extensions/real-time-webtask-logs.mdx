The Real-time Webtask Logs extension displays all logs in real-time for the custom code in your account. This includes all `console.log` output and exceptions. `Console.logs` are helpful if you have issues with database scripts. You can view the results from your database scripts such as success messages, error messages, and `console.log()` statements.

To learn more, see [Real-time Auth0 Webtask Logs](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-realtime-logs) in Auth0's Github repository.

<Warning>

The Real-time Webtask Logs extension uses the user's request, so you should be cautious about logging sensitive information. For example, your custom database scripts work extensively with the `user` object, which may contain sensitive information. Logging the complete object may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information in the Webtask Logs extension.

Auth0 strongly discourages such practices. **We suggest that you be aware of the objects that you log and ensure sensitive information is not logged.**

</Warning>

## Configure the extension

To install and configure this extension:

1. Navigate to the [Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) page of the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#), and click the **Real-time Webtask Logs** box. The **Install Extension** window opens.
2. Click the **Install** button.

## Use the extension

To view your logs:

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions), and select **Installed Extensions**.
2. Select **Real-time Webtask Logs**.

To view the logs in fullscreen mode, click **Full Screen Mode**. To exit fullscreen mode, press the **Escape** key.

## Debug rules

You can use the Real-time Webtask Logs extension to debug any Rules in your implementation, including all `console.log` output and exceptions. To learn more, read [Auth0 Rules](/docs/customize/rules).

In the following example, you will create a generic Hello World rule, run it, and use the Real-time Webtask Logs extension to see the results.

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Auth Pipeline > Rules](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules), and select **Create Rule**.
2. Select the **Empty rule** template, paste the code below (or modify it as you like), and **Save Changes**.

   ```javascript lines
   function (user, context, callback) {
     user.hello = 'world';
     console.log('===> set "hello" for ' + user.name);
     callback(null, user, context);
   }
   ```


   

   
3. Open a new tab, navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions), and select **Installed Extensions**.
4. Select **Real-time Webtask Logs**. You are now viewing logs real-time and are ready to try your rule.
5. Switch to your Rules tab, and click **Try This Rule**.
6. Switch to your Real-time Webtask Logs tab to see the results.
