<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Auth0 provides two ways to implement role-based access control (RBAC), which you can use in place of or in combination with your API's own internal access control system:

* [Authorization Core](/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac)
* [Authorization Extension](/docs/customize/extensions/authorization-extension)

The Authorization Core feature set matches the functionality of the Authorization Extension, improves performance and scalability, and provides a more flexible RBAC system than the Authorization Extension.

Currently, both implement the key features of RBAC and allow you to restrict the custom scopes defined for an API to those that have been assigned to the user as permissions.

</Callout>

You can import new data from or export existing authorization data to a JSON file. This can be useful when moving environments.

Roles and permissions are linked to specific applications. If you export your JSON file and import it into a different environment, you will need to change the client ID for these records.

1. Go to the **Import/Export** section by clicking **Configuration** on the drop-down menu accessible by clicking on your tenant name at the top right of the **Authorization Dashboard**.

2. Select **Import/Export**.

3. Use this form to copy and paste or edit the JSON data. Then, click either the **Import** or **Export** button to begin the import/export process. Here is an example of the JSON file:
