<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

Auth0 provides two ways to implement role-based access control (RBAC), which you can use in place of or in combination with your API's own internal access control system:

* [Authorization Core](/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac)
* [Authorization Extension](/docs/customize/extensions/authorization-extension)

The Authorization Core feature set matches the functionality of the Authorization Extension, improves performance and scalability, and provides a more flexible RBAC system than the Authorization Extension.

Currently, both implement the key features of RBAC and allow you to restrict the custom scopes defined for an API to those that have been assigned to the user as permissions.

</Callout>

One of the major changes between versions 1 and 2 of the Authorization Extension is the removal of the **Applications** section. This section was removed to simplify its inherent complexity, such as when it was used to define a policy for access control. The desired approach for such use cases is to use [rules](/docs/customize/rules).

## Upgrade extension version

To upgrade the Authorization Extension, go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions), and select the **Installed Extensions** view.

On the Authorization Extension row, you'll see a link that will begin the upgrade process to the latest version.
