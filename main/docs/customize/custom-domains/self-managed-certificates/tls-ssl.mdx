<Card title="Before you start">

Auth0's network edge requires a Server Name Indication (SNI) to be set on all requests. Most clients set SNI by default; if your web client does not, consult your web client documentation to determine how to manually set an SNI.

</Card>

Auth0â€™s network edge has a secure set of allowed SSL/TLS version/cipher suite combinations. When connecting to Auth0 services using a reverse proxy with self-managed certificates, you **must** use a supported TLS version and cipher suite. During the TLS handshake, communication between the server and client specifies the TLS version and cipher suite. If you are not using a supported version, a failure could occur.

## Supported Versions

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If you are using self-managed certificates in your custom domain, they must be compatible with one of the below TLS versions and ciphers. For security purposes, a protocol or cipher could be removed from support without notice.

</Callout>

Auth requires using TLS version 1.2 or 1.3 with the supported ciphers.
