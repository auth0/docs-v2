<Card title="Before you start">

Auth0's network edge requires a Server Name Indication (SNI) to be set on all requests. Most clients set SNI by default; if your web client does not, consult your web client documentation to determine how to manually set an SNI.

</Card>

Auth0’s network edge has a secure set of allowed SSL/TLS version/cipher suite combinations. When connecting to Auth0 services using a reverse proxy with self-managed certificates, you **must** use a supported TLS version and cipher suite. During the TLS handshake, communication between the server and client specifies the TLS version and cipher suite. If you are not using a supported version, a failure could occur.

## Supported Versions

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If you are using self-managed certificates in your custom domain, they must be compatible with one of the below TLS versions and ciphers. For security purposes, a protocol or cipher could be removed from support without notice.

</Callout>

Auth0 requires using TLS version 1.2 or 1.3 with the supported ciphers.

#### TLS 1.3 Supported Ciphers

TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

#### TLS 1.2 Supported Ciphers

TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

## Deprecated versions

<Warning>
Although they remain available in some environments, the following TLS 1.2 cipher suites are deprecated and will reach end-of-support in June 2026. To learn more, read [Weak TLS 1.2 Cipher Suites](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations#weak-tls-1-2-cipher-suites).
