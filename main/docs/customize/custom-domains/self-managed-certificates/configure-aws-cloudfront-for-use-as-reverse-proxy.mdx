   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>

   <td>Set this to the <strong>Origin Domain Name</strong> value obtained from the Auth0 Dashboard during the Custom Domains setup process</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Origin ID</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

This can be found by clicking on your Distribution ID, under the General tab, Domain Name (for example, `e2zwy42nt1feu7.cloudfront.net`). You can also use an Alias record if Route 53 is configured for your domain.
