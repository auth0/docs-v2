<Card title="Before you start">

If you use [Passwordless SMS authentication](/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/use-sms-gateway-passwordless), [MFA SMS and voice notifications](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors/configure-sms-voice-notifications-mfa), or Phone as ID, you need to configure a phone provider with the Unified Phone Experience.

If you need different providers for MFA, Passwordless, and/or Phone as ID, you must configure a [custom phone provider](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider) using Auth0 Actions.

</Card>

The Unified Phone Experience centralizes all phone provider configurations in one location in your tenant. This centralization eliminates the need to configure a phone provider multiple times for various phone authentication factors.

If you want to try out phone messaging capabilities, you need to configure a tenant-level phone provider.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Auth0 does not provide feedback to the end user on whether a phone message has been sent successfully with the tenant-level provider. To troubleshoot issues, review the [tenant logs](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs).

</Callout>

## Configure MFA

You can use the Unified Phone Experience with SMS, Voice, and SMS + Voice delivery methods and factors.

</Callout>

### Test your phone provider

Test the tenant-level provider before using it in a production environment:

1. Navigate to [**Branding > Phone Provider**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/phone/templates/phone/provider).
2. Select **Send Test Message** to test the tenant-level provider before using it in a production environment.

## Configure phone templates

The tenant-level phone provider uses [Liquid syntax](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) to inject contextual variables into your phone message content. To configure your phone templates, follow the instructions in [Customize Phone Templates](/docs/customize/phone-messages/customize-phone-templates).

## Disable phone provider

If you configure the Unified Phone Experience and then disable it, existing integrations with your phone provider could break, including your MFA phone factor.
