Phone messaging providers are currently in Early Access. To learn more about Auth0 releases, review [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

</Callout>

Auth0 allows you to configure your own phone messaging provider to help you manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your SMS and voice communications. You can only configure one phone provider for all SMS and voice communications per tenant.

Auth0 currently supports the following phone messaging providers:

* [Twilio](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-twilio-as-a-phone-messaging-provider)
* [Custom phone provider](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider)

You can also configure a custom phone provider using Actions. To learn more, read [Configure a Custom Phone Provider](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider) and [Actions Triggers: custom-phone-provider Event Object](/docs/customize/phone-messages/configure-phone-messaging-providers/configure-a-custom-phone-provider/actions-triggers-custom-phone-provider-event-object).
