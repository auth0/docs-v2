Auth0 allows you to configure a phone provider for <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Multi-Factor+Authentication">Multi-Factor Authentication</Tooltip> (MFA) and <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> at the tenant-level with the Unified Phone Experience. This eliminates the need to configure a phone provider in multiple locations while maintaining flexibility when configuring delivery methods.

Tenants with configured phone providers can migrate to the Unified Phone Experience and maintain phone messaging capabilities in one place. New tenants are automatically enrolled in the Unified Phone Experience.
