<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Phone messaging providers are currently in Early Access. To learn more about Auth0 releases, review [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Twilio](https://twilio.com/) account with a valid SMS and/or phone delivery option.

## Configure Twilio

1. Log in to your [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/login) account.
2. Go to your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/). You will need your Twilio SID and Twilio Auth Token when configuring Twilio in your Auth0 Dashboard.
3. Go to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Phone Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/phone/provider). Select **Twilio** as your **Phone Provider**.
4. Select a **Delivery Method**. You can choose **Text**, **Voice**, or both as delivery methods for your customers.
5. For the **Twilio Provider Settings**, select an **SMS Source**:

   1. If you select **Use From**, enter a default phone number from which customers will receive phone messages.
   2. If you select [Messaging Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/services), enter your Twilio Messaging Service SID. You can find this value in your Twilio Console.
   3. Enter your Twilio SID and Twilio Auth Token from the Twilio Console. Click **Save**.

## Test phone

Click the **Try** button to send a test phone message. If you have successfully configured Twilio as an external phone provider, Auth0 will send a confirmation phone message using the selected delivery method. If you do not receive a phone message after a few minutes, check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for failures.

The Twilio [Messaging Activity](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/overview) page displays delivery insights for all SMS that have been sent to your users.
