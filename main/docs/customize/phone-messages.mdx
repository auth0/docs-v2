Auth0â€™s default phone message flow addresses the requirements of most applications. You may want to customize your phone message flow, such as in the following use cases:

* Localize your phone messages to meet the needs of different target markets.
* Set a custom sending phone number based on the user or tenant.
* Enable different phone message templates per application or tenant.

The [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) provides endpoints to help you manage your phone message flow to control when and how phone messages are sent. You can also implement and manage your own custom phone endpoints using the Auth0 <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.
