**Advanced Customizations for Universal Login** (ACUL) allows you to take Auth0’s hosted login solution further to give you extensive control of your login experience to support a variety of use cases and business needs. 


[Auth0’s Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) provides end-to-end user authentication and authorization with access to Auth0’s many services and features, such as Attack Protection and Organizations. ACUL extends the capabilities of Universal Login to support multi-branding, complex security configurations, and integration of numerous analytic platforms.


With ACUL, you can write code in your preferred framework, integrate your existing analytics platform to configure A/B testing, and define the user-experience. The ACUL SDKs act as the connection between your custom code and Universal Login.


## Benefits
  * Extend the capabilities of Auth0’s Universal Login to support multiple brands in one tenant.
  * Take advantage of Auth0’s features, such as [Passkeys](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/passkeys), [Bot Detection](/docs/secure/attack-protection/bot-detection), and [MFA factors](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication), without rebuilding your authentication logic.
  * Integrate advanced analytics and A/B testing to optimize the user journey.
  * Use the ACUL JS SDK to build with your own tech stack. You can:
    * Use any CSS or component library
    * Integrate your preferred analytics platform, such as Snowflake
    * Build with your preferred framework, such as Vue or React

## Use cases
You want to use ACUL with your Universal Login implementation if:
  * You want end-users to login with their specific organization branding
  * You want to bring your own assets to use in the login experience

To learn more, read ACUL Use Cases. 

## How it works

<span style="color:red">Need Image</span>

1. Start by building in your own environment. Use the [ACUL SDKs](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference) to submit your custom code to define prompts and screens with your preferred tech stack, like React or Python. 
  * When you push commits, your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) runs the build process and compiles your application into static JavaScript and CSS assets.
2. Your assets upload to your private cloud storage from your CI/CD pipeline. Your private cloud storage serves as your own Content Delivery Network (CDN).
3. Assets deploy as a public URL.
4. Use the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/universal-login/customize-screens) or  [Management API](/docs/api/management/v2) to update your Auth0 tenant assets.

You must have an access token to use Management API. To learn more, read [Management API Access Token](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens).
</Callout>
5. During runtime, your application redirects end-users to your login page. Simultaneously:
  * The Auth0 server recognizes the authentication screen you configured to use ACUL and serves a minimal host page.
  * The user's browser loads this page, which contains HTML tags pointing to your asset URLs on your CDN. The browser downloads your JavaScript and CSS, verifies their integrity using the SRI hashes, and renders your custom UI. From here, your application code and the ACUL SDK manage the rest of the user's interaction.

## Requirements

To start with Advanced Customization for Universal Login, you must:

  * Have an Auth0 account and tenant
<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
We recommend you create a tenant for testing, development, and production with appropriate environment tags.
</Callout>
  * [Register an application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications)
  * Configure connections, such as Enterprise, Social, or Database
  * Determine your authentication methods, such as [Passwordless](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/passwordless-login)
  * [Configure Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login)
  * Configure your application to call the [Login endpoint](/docs/api/authentication#login) of Authentication API to trigger the login flow and handle the response.To learn more, read [Implement Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login#implement-universal-login).
  * Configure and verify a [Custom Domain](/docs/customize/custom-domains) or [Multiple Custom Domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains/multiple-custom-domains)
  * A CDN with an included CI/CD pipeline, such as GitHub, to host assets

You  need to use:
  * [Node.js](http://Node.js)
  * The [Auth0 CLI Tool](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli)
