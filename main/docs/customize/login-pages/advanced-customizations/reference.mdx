Auth0 supplies a choice of SDKs to use with ACUL.

## ACUL SDKs

	* [Auth0 ACUL React SDK](/docs/libraries/acul/react-sdk)
	Provides React Hooks to simplify integration within React applications.

	* [Auth0 ACUL JS SDK](/docs/libraries/acul/js-sdk)
	The core JavaScript library (written in Typescript), suitable for use with any frontend framework or plain JavaScript.


## ACUL sample applications

The [ACUL sample applications](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-acul-samples) include a full build pipeline, deployment workflows, and implementations for common Universal Login screens. These sample applications assist you in the development of your screens. The samples are available in React using the ACUL React and JS SDKs.  

You can use the `auth0 acul init` command to initialize a starter React project with either the ACUL React or JS SDKs. To learn more, read [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli) on GitHub. 

## ACUL resources
Auth0 provides several resources to customize your Universal Login experience.

### Auth0 Management API

Update individual Universal Login screens or configure multiple screens at once with Management API. To use Auth0 Management API, you must have an [access token](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens).

**Individual screen configuration**

		* The [`GET /v2/prompts/{prompt}/screen/{screen}/rendering` endpoint](/docs/api/management/v2/prompts/get-rendering) allows you to retrieve the configuration for a single screen.

		* The [`PATCH /v2/prompts/{prompt}/screen/{screen}/rendering` endpoint](/docs/api/management/v2/prompts/patch-rendering) allows you to configure ACUL on a single screen.

**Bulk screen configuration**

		* The [`GET /v2/prompts/rendering` endpoint](/docs/api/management/v2/prompts/get-all-rendering) allows you to retrieve configurations for all the screens.

		* The [`PATCH /v2/prompts/rendering` endpoint](/docs/api/management/v2/prompts/patch-bulk-rendering) allows you to update screens in bulk.

### Auth0 developer tools

Auth0 provides several tools to simplify tenant management including ACUL configuration.
