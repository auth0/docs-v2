<Card title="Before you start">

* An Auth0 development tenant configured with [Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) and [custom domain](/docs/customize/custom-domains).
* Enable [Identifier First Authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/identifier-first) 
* [Node.js](http://Node.js) V18+ installed.
* [Auth0 CLI](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/) installed and configured with your development tenant.

The Auth0 ACUL React SDK allows you to implement Advanced Customization for Universal Login (ACUL). It simplifies integrating authentication screens such as Login, Signup, Passwordless, Passkey enrollment, among others screens, into your web applications.

Create a preview of a customized Login ID screen using Auth0 ACUL, follow these steps:

## 1. Initialize ACUL with Auth0 CLI

Use the following command to interactively initialize ACUL in your project directory: 

```bash
auth0 acul init acul-screens
```

1. Select **React (with ACUL React SDK)** 
2. Select the **login-id** screen

Auth0 CLI creates the `acul-screens` directory, installs dependencies and downloads the template. Change directory to the `acul-screens` directory:

```bash
cd acul-screens
```


## 2. Use the Universal Login Context Inspector 
The Universal Login Context Inspector is a utility that runs locally that allows you to view and edit the login-id screen.

Use the following commands to run the Universal Login Context Inspector:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run screen login-id
```

The Universal Login Context Inspector opens in a new split-panelled browser window `http://localhost:3000`, the inspector opens in the right panel and the rendered login-id screen opens in the left panel.

The Universal Login Context Inspector is a utility that allows you to view and edit Universal Login context data as JSON. You can use it to see your customized Universal Login screens in real-time. 
</Callout>

## 3. Edit the Login-Id screen

Follow these steps to customize the Login-Id screen:

1. Open a new terminal and navigate your project’s `acul-screens` directory
2. Edit the file `src/screens/login-id/LoginId.tsx` 
3. Change the `<h1>` element from `Welcome` to `Welcome to My Awesome App.`
4. Save the file to save your changes 

Once the file `src/screens/login-id/LoginId.tsx` is saved, the Universal Login Context Inspector renders the updated screen on the left panel. 

## 4. Test ACUL with your tenant

Use Auth0 CLI to connect with your Auth0 development tenant and create a live test of the ACUL `login` screen. 

1. Use `CTRL+C` to interrupt the process of `npm run screen login-id`   
2. In the `acul-screens` directory, run the following command:

```bash
auth0 acul dev
```	

Auth0 CLI monitors updates to the `src` directory, rebuilds your updated screen assets in the local `dist` directory, runs a local server, and updates your tenant to render the Universal Login screens locally. 

Use your code editor to make additional customizations and see updates after a browser refresh of the Universal Login screen. 

Once done testing and to revert your tenant’s configuration back to default, you can use `CTRL+C` to interrupt the process `auth0 acul dev`

To have a live test and local rendered screen side-by-side comparison,  you can also keep the `npm run screen login-id` process running and start the `auth0 acul dev` process in a new terminal.

Auth0 CLI detects that port 3000 is in use and runs its asset server on a different port.

## Checkpoint
Auth0 CLI starts the development process and renders the customized Universal Login screen including your `Welcome to My Awesome App` text.
