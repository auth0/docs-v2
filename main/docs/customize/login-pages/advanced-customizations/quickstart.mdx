You need:
* An Auth0 development tenant configured with [Universal Login](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login) and [custom domain](/docs/customize/custom-domains)

The Auth0 ACUL React SDK allows you to implement Advanced Customization for Universal Login (ACUL). It simplifies integrating authentication screens such as Login, Signup, Passwordless, Passkey enrollment, among others screens, into your web applications.

To create an ACUL `login_id` screen using Auth0 CLI, follow these steps:

## 1. Initialize an ACUL sample application

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
If you have not configured your development tenant with Auth0 CLI, use the `auth0 login` command to configure your tenant. 
</Callout>

Navigate to where you wish to create the project and run the following command:

```bash
auth0 acul init "Your_App_Name"
```

1. Select **React (with ACUL React SDK)** 
2. Select the **login-id** screen

A new project directory is created with the provided application name. 

Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. (Optional) Add additional screens to your project 
To select additional screens for your project, run the following command:

```bash
auth0 acul screen add 
```

## 3. Build the Login Id screen with Auth0 CLI 

```bash
auth0 acul dev --connected
```
1. Select your project directory
2. **Proceed with connected mode:**  Enter Yes
3. Select the `login-id` screen 
4. **Enter the port for serving assets:** (By default 8080) 
5. **Would you like to run 'npm run build:watch' in the background?** Enter Yes

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
The `auth0 acul dev —-connected` command builds the ACUL screens, hosts your assets locally, and continuously watches for updates to the assets directory. 
</Callout>

## 4. Login to your ACUL Login Id screen

Open a new terminal window to login to your ACUL `login-id` screen:

```bash
auth0 test login
```	

1. Select your Auth0 Application to start the Login flow
2. Select your Custom Domain
3. **Do you wish to proceed?** Enter Yes

A new browser window opens your ACUL `login-id` screen connected to your Auth0 development tenant. 

## 5. Update your ACUL Login Id screen

Auth0 CLI monitors for updates and serves local assets from your project’s `/dist/assets/{screen}` directory.

Use your code editor to make additional customizations and refresh your ACUL `login-id` browser window to see your changes live.
