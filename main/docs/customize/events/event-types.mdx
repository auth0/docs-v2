<Warning>

**Events are currently available in Early Access**.

To learn more about Auth0's product release cycle, review [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

</Warning>

You can create event streams that listen for different types of events, such as the creation of a new user profile. The sections below outline specific details for currently supported event types.
