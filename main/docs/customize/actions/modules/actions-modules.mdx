<Warning>
Actions Modules is currently available in Early Access. By using this feature, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/legal/). To learn more about Auth0’s release stages, read [Product Release Stages](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).
</Warning>

Actions Modules allow you to create, manage, and share reusable code across different Actions within your Auth0 Tenant.

Previously, each Action operated independently, making it difficult to share common functions between them without using external dependencies like NPM Modules. With Actions Modules, now it's possible to:

* Create custom modules with functions hosted by Auth0.
* Use the functions defined at each custom module within one or more Actions.
* Each custom module can define independent secrets and add dependencies to NPM modules.

To learn more about writing Actions with Actions Modules, read [Write Your First Action Module](/docs/customize/actions/modules/write-your-first-action-module).

Actions Modules are not bound to a particular Trigger or Action type, therefore the functions defined them can be reused across Actions bound to different Triggers.

## Performance

By adopting Action Modules according to the [Coding Guidelines](/docs/customize/actions/action-coding-guidelines), you can improve execution performance by sharing and reusing objects that have a costly instantiation process.

However, the improvement is not guaranteed, as it depends on the specific use case, the implementation, and the load and frequency of executions.
