Triggers are points in the Auth0 process where Actions can be added for required customization. Multiple Actions can be placed in a Trigger, executing in sequence. Triggers can be synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous (non-blocking).
Each trigger has specific Objects and APIs. They may differ based on your connection (such as <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=passwordless">passwordless</Tooltip> connection).

To explore reference Objects and APIs for specific Actions for a trigger, select the trigger below, noting Auth0's definition of a [passwordless connection](/docs/authenticate/passwordless).

#### Signup and Login

When a user is added to a database or passwordless connection (Signup), or as part of a user's authentication transaction (Login).
