The API object for the post-user-registration Actions trigger includes:

## `api.cache`

Store and retrieve data that persists across executions.

### `api.cache.delete(key)`

Delete a record describing a cached value at the supplied key if it exists.

Returns a `CacheWriteResult` object with  `type: "success"` if a value was removed from the cache. A failed operation returns `type: "error"`. For errors, the returned object will have a
`code` property that indicates the nature of the failure.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>String</em>. The key of the record stored in the cache.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `api.cache.get(key)`

Retrieve a record describing a cached value at the supplied
`key`, if it exists. If a record is found, the cached value can
be found at the `value` property of the returned object.

Returns a cache record if an item is found in the cache for the supplied
`key`. Cache records are objects with a
`value` property holding the cached value as well as an
`expires_at` property indicating the maximum expiry of
the record in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

**Important:**
This cache is designed for short-lived, ephemeral data. Items may not be
available in later transactions even if they are within their supplied their
lifetime.

<table class="table">

<th>Parameter</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>String</em>. The key of the record stored in the cache.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `api.cache.set(key, value, [options])`

Store or update a string value in the cache at the specified key.

Values stored in this cache are scoped to the Trigger in which they are set.
They are subject to the
[Actions Cache Limits](/docs/customize/actions/limitations).

Values stored in this way will have lifetimes of up to the specified
`ttl` or `expires_at` values. If no lifetime is
specified, a default of lifetime of 15 minutes will be used. Lifetimes may
not exceed the maximum duration listed at
[Actions Cache Limits](/docs/customize/actions/limitations).

            <code>expires_at</code>.
          </p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> This value should not be supplied if a value was also
            provided for <code>ttl</code>. If both options are supplied, the
            earlier expiry of the two will be used.
