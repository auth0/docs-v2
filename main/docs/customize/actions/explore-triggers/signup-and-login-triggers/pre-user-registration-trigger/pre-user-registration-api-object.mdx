The API object for the pre-user-registration Actions trigger includes:

## `api.access`

Modify the access of the user that is logging in, such as rejecting the registration attempt.

### `api.access.deny(reason, userMessage)`

Deny the user from being able to register. The signup flow will immediately stop following the completion of this action and no further Actions will be executed.

Returns a reference to the `api` object.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>reason</code></td>
<td>
<p>
<em>String</em>. An internal reason describing why this registration attempt is being denied. This value
   will appear in tenant logs.
          </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>userMessage</code></td>
<td>
<p>
<em>String</em>. A human-readable explanation for rejecting the registration attempt. This may be presented
   directly in end-user interfaces.
          </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## `api.cache`

Store and retrieve data that persists across executions.

### `api.cache.delete(key)`

Delete a record describing a cached value at the supplied key if it exists.

Returns a `CacheWriteResult` object with  `type: "success"` if a value was removed from the cache. A failed operation returns `type: "error"`. For errors, the returned object will have a
`code` property that indicates the nature of the failure.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>String</em>. The key of the record stored in the cache.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `api.cache.get(key)`

Retrieve a record describing a cached value at the supplied
`key`, if it exists. If a record is found, the cached value can
be found at the `value` property of the returned object.

Returns a cache record if an item is found in the cache for the supplied
`key`. Cache records are objects with a
`value` property holding the cached value as well as an
`expires_at` property indicating the maximum expiry of
the record in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

**Important:**
This cache is designed for short-lived, ephemeral data. Items may not be
available in later transactions even if they are within their supplied their
lifetime.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>String</em>. The key of the record stored in the cache.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `api.cache.set(key, value, [options])`

Store or update a string value in the cache at the specified key.

Values stored in this cache are scoped to the Trigger in which they are set.
They are subject to the
[Actions Cache Limits](/docs/customize/actions/limitations).

Values stored in this way will have lifetimes of up to the specified
`ttl` or `expires_at` values. If no lifetime is
specified, a default of lifetime of 15 minutes will be used. Lifetimes may
not exceed the maximum duration listed at
[Actions Cache Limits](/docs/customize/actions/limitations).

<table class="table">

<tr>
<td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>String</em>. The key of the record stored in the cache.</p>

</td>

            since the unix epoch. While cached records may be evicted earlier,
            they will never remain beyond the the supplied
            <code>expires_at</code>.
          </p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> This value should not be supplied if a value was also
            provided for <code>ttl</code>. If both options are supplied, the
            earlier expiry of the two will be used.
          </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>options.ttl</code></td>

<p>
<em>Optional number</em>. The time-to-live value of this cache entry
            in milliseconds. While cached values may be evicted earlier, they
            will never remain beyond the the supplied <code>ttl</code>.
          </p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> This value should not be supplied if a value was also
            provided for <code>expires_at</code>. If both options are supplied,

## `api.user`

Make changes to the metadata of the user that is registering.

### `api.user.setUserMetadata(name, value)`

Set metadata for the user that is registering. Data stored within user_metadata is visible and editable by the user.

Note: This trigger makes a call to the Management API, consuming the Management API rate limit. If this request reaches the rate limit and fails to retry within the timeout window, the API returns a `Deadline Exceeded` error.

Returns a reference to the `api` object.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>
<em>String</em>. The name of metadata property.
          </p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>value</code></td>
<td>
<p><em>Any value</em>. The value of the metadata property. This may be set to `null` to remove the metadata property.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `api.user.setAppMetadata(name, value)`

Set application metadata for the user that is registering. Data stored within app_metadata is not visible or editable by the user.

Note: This trigger makes a call to the Management API, consuming the Management API rate limit. If this request reaches the rate limit and fails to retry within the timeout window, the API returns a `Deadline Exceeded` error.

Returns a reference to the `api` object.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>name</code></td>

<em>String</em>. The name of metadata property.

<tr>

<td>
<p><em>Any value</em>. The value of the metadata property. This may be set to `null` to remove the metadata property.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## `api.validation`

Configure custom error messaging for denied user registrations.

### `api.validation.error(errorCode, errorMessage)`

Define custom error codes and user messaging for denied registration attempts.

When a user's attempt to register is denied, the signup flow immediately stops following the completion of the current Action and no further Actions are executed.

<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>errorCode</code></td>
<td>
<p>
<em>String</em>. A custom error code that describes why a registration attempt was denied. This value appears in tenant logs.
