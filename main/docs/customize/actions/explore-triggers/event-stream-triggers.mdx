The Event Stream trigger runs when an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip> is being issued via the [Client Credentials Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow).

Actions in this flow are non-blocking (asynchronous), which means the Auth0 pipeline will continue to run without waiting for the Action to finish its execution. Thus, the Action’s outcome does not affect the Auth0 transaction.

## Triggers

### Event Stream

The `event-stream` triggers are functions executed TBD.

#### References

* [Event object](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/event-stream-triggers/event-stream-event-object): Provides contextual information about the request for a client credentials exchange.
* [API object](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/event-stream-triggers/event-stream-api-object): Provides methods for changing the behavior of the flow.

## Common use cases

### Notification

A credentials-exchange Action can be used to deny an access token based on custom logic.

```javascript lines
/**
* Handler to be executed while processing events in an Event Stream.
* @param {Event} event - Details about the incoming event.
* @param {EventStreamAPI} api - Methods and utilities to define event stream processing.
*/
exports.onExecuteEventStream = async (event, api) => {
  return;
};
```

### Synchronization

A credentials-exchange Action can be used to deny an access token based on custom logic.

```javascript lines
/**
* Handler to be executed while processing events in an Event Stream.
* @param {Event} event - Details about the incoming event.
* @param {EventStreamAPI} api - Methods and utilities to define event stream processing.
*/
exports.onExecuteEventStream = async (event, api) => {
  return;
};
```
