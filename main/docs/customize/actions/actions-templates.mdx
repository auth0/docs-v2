---
The Actions Template gallery offers a variety of starter templates for creating an Action. These templates provide sample code covering various triggers and use cases, such as <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Multi-factor+Authentication">Multi-factor Authentication</Tooltip>, Access Control, and Profile Enrichment.

Templates provide starter code that you can modify and use as a building block as part of a trigger. Once you select a template for your specific use case, you can then customize the code to fit the individual needs of your application.

For a step-by-step guide on using Actions Templates, see [Write Your First Action](/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action).

## Best Practices

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Action Templates are designed for educational purposes only.

These templates consist of incomplete code snippets, and should not be used in a production environment under any circumstances. Developers are responsible for securely developing and completing the Action Template before deploying to a production environment.

</Callout>

* Ensure that the templates are custom for your specific environment. As the code is incomplete, you must personalize and complete the samples before importing them into a production environment.
* Do not deploy a template without editing and completing it beforehand.
* Actions Templates often contain tags in the comments, which should not be modified or deleted.
* Always use the latest version of any `npm` package.
* Actions Templates target the latest Node.js versions by default. After creating a template, you can modify it to support additional Node.js version(s) as necessary.

Please review all [Actions Coding Guidelines](/docs/customize/actions/action-coding-guidelines) as they apply here as well.
