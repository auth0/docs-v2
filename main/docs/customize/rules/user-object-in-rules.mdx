<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

</Warning>

The `user` object stores information about the logged-in user, returned by the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip>. It is generated when a user authenticates and before rules run. Because of the order of events when a user authenticates, changes made to a user's profile from within a rule will only be available in the current user object if you also save the changes to the user object from within the same rule.

To learn more about the authentication transaction flow, read the "How rules work" section in [Create Rules](/docs/customize/rules/create-rules).

<Warning>

Use unique names for root properties in the user object and properties within `app_metadata`. Because properties within `app_metadata` are merged into the user object, root properties that share names with properties in `app_metadata` may have their values overwritten when running rules.

</Warning>

## Properties

The following properties are available for the `user` object.

<table class="table">

Users may also <a href="/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking">link their profile to multiple identity providers</a>; those identities will then also appear in this array. The contents of an individual identity provider object varies by provider, but it will typically include the following:<ul>
<li><code>connection</code> (text): Name of the Auth0 connection used to authenticate the user.</li>
<li><code>isSocial</code> (boolean): Indicates whether the connection is a social one.</li>
<li><code>provider</code> (text): Name of the entity that is authenticating the user, such as Facebook, Google, SAML, or your own provider.</li>
<li><code>user_id</code> (text): User's unique identifier for this connection/provider. The first user_id linked becomes the primary unique identifier for the user.</li>
<li><code>profileData</code> (object): User information associated with the connection. When profiles are linked, it is populated with the associated user info for secondary accounts.</li></ul>
In some cases, it will also include an API <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip> to be used with the provider.
