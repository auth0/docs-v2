<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

</Warning>

The global `configuration` object is available in Rules for storing commonly used values, such as URLs. Sensitive information, such as credentials or API keys, should be stored through the `configuration` object and kept out of your Rules code.

## Configure values

You can set configuration values in your [Rules Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules/) on the Dashboard.

To edit or change a configuration key's value, remove the existing configuration setting and replace it with the updated value. You need to have created at least one Rule to see the configuration area, otherwise, the Rules demo shows instead.

## Use the configuration object

Any configuration values you set can be accessed through the `configuration` object by key in your Rules code.

```javascript lines
var MY_API_KEY = configuration.MY_API_KEY;
```






The following example is a Rule for sending a Slack message when a new user has signed up. The [Slack Webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) is a `configuration` value set with the key `SLACK_HOOK_URL`.

```javascript lines
function (user, context, callback) {
  // short-circuit if the user signed up already or is using a Refresh Token
  if (context.stats.loginsCount > 1 || context.protocol === 'oauth2-refresh-token') {
    return callback(null, user, context);
  }

  // get your slack's hook url from: https://slack.com/services/10525858050
  const SLACK_HOOK = configuration.SLACK_HOOK_URL;

  const slack = require('slack-notify')(SLACK_HOOK);
  const message = 'New User: ' + (user.name || user.email) + ' (' + user.email + ')';
  const channel = '#some_channel';

  slack.success({
    text: message,
    channel: channel
  });

  // donâ€™t wait for the Slack API call to finish, return right away (the request will continue on the sandbox)`
  callback(null, user, context);
}
```
