You can use the **Auth0 App for Splunk** to visualize the data from your Auth0 tenant in a Splunk dashboard. The dashboard allows you to monitor the health of the login traffic for a tenant. The app allows you to use recommended aggregations from Auth0, or to use them as a starting point to create your own custom visualizations.

## Install the Auth0 App for Splunk

1. Log into [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/).
2. Navigate to the [Auth0 App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5193) app page.
3. Select the green **Install** button.
4. Enter your username and password, accept the terms and conditions, and select **Login and Install**.
5. On the **Complete** widget that results, select the **Open the App** button.
   The Auth0 Dashboard with default filters applied appears.

## Dashboard filters

The following filters exist to allow you to drill down into the specifics of your traffic. You can enter `*` to search across all values for that field.

<table class="table"><thead>

<tbody>
