You can troubleshoot potential issues with your stream by looking at the **Health** tab.

1. Go to [Dashboard > Monitoring > Streams](https://manage.auth0.com/#/log-streams).
2. Locate the log stream you want to check in the list.

   Your log stream can have one of the following statuses:

   * **Active**: Your stream is enabled with us, and we will attempt to deliver the next log events.
   * **Paused**: You have requested that we stop delivery attempts for the stream. You can click **Resume Stream** to change the status back to **Active**.
   * **Disabled**: We have disabled your stream because of successive errors. You can click **Restart Stream** to change the status back to **Active** and retry delivery for this stream.
3. Select the more options menu (...) at the end of the stream, and click **Health** on the drop-down menu. To help diagnose issues with your stream, you can see the last ten errors we encountered while attempting to deliver logs to your stream within the last 5 days.
