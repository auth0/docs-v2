Auth0 provides predefined templates that you can use to visualize the data from your Auth0 tenant in Datadog. Display visualizations to monitor the health of the login traffic for a tenant. Templates allow you to use recommended aggregations from Auth0, or to use them as a starting point to create your own custom visualizations.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Template</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
<th>Downloadable File</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Security Dashboard</td>
<td>Monitor tenant login traffic including login, account creation, and anomaly detection metrics.</td>
<td><a href="https://cdn.auth0.com/website/docs/logs/streams/datadog/Auth0SecurityDashboard.json">Auth0SecDashboard.json</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can also organize your visualization using the following features:

* Use Datadog time selection to choose the window for your visualization.
* Use filters to narrow down data analysis using configurable parameters such as IP address, Country, User, and Client Application.
* Use **Edit Widgets** to rearrange the tiles and visualizations, as well as create copies where you can inspect and add parameters to queries as needed.

## Prerequisites

* [Set up log streaming to Datadog](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/datadog-log-streaming).
* Download the desired dashboard template JSON file from Auth0.

## Upload dashboard templates in Datadog

1. Log into [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
2. Navigate to **Dashboards** on the left navigation bar.
3. Select **Screenboard** as the dashboard type.
4. On the blank canvas, in the upper right, select the gear icon and click **Import Dashboard JSON**.
5. Upload the JSON file for the dashboard you wish to use (for example, `Auth0SecDashboard.json`).

## Security Dashboard visualizations

Once you have imported the Security Dashboard from Auth0, you can use the following visualizations to determine the health of your tenant or as a starting point to build your own visualizations and alerts in Datadog.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Visualization</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Login Success</td>
<td>Displays the number of successful login events for the tenant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Login Failures</td>
<td>Displays the number of failed login events for the tenant.  Spikes in login failures may be a signal of anomalous traffic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Login Failures by Geolocation</td>
<td>Displays the number of failed login events for the tenant by geolocation.  Unexpected traffic spikes in certain geographies may be a signal of anomalous traffic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of Unique IPs sending traffic</td>
<td>Displays the number of IP addresses that are sending traffic to the tenant.  This number often follows predictable patterns, and strong variations may signal anomalous traffic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Top 5 IPs with failures</td>
<td>Displays the 5 IP addresses that have experienced the highest number of login errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account Creation Events in top countries</td>
<td>Displays the number of accounts created in the top countries.   Variations in the predictable patterns and geographies may signal anomalous traffic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account Creation Events by Platform</td>
<td>Displays the number of accounts created by platform, such as Windows, OSX, Android, or iOS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IPs with most accounts created</td>
<td>Displays the IP addresses from which the most number of accounts have been created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anomaly Detection Events</td>
<td>Displays the number of anomaly detection events for the tenant, including the number of blocked IP addresses due to Brute Force Protection and Breached Password Detection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Log Stream</td>
<td>Displays raw events from the tenant log.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
