All data in your Auth0 tenant is always under your control and is available through the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> at any time.

## User passwords

The only information which is not available through the API (for security reasons) are the password hashes of your Auth0-hosted database users and private keys. You can still request this information by opening a [support ticket](https://support.auth0.com). This operation is not available for our Free subscription tier, and we are unable to accept or guarantee requests for exports at a specific time and date.

If you store user passwords in your database, set up a custom database connection which Auth0 will query each time a user logs in. In this case, Auth0 will never store any password hashes, unless you choose to progressively migrate users to Auth0.

## Auth0 components

Auth0 primarily uses <Tooltip tip="OpenID: Open standard for authentication that allows applications to verify users' identities without collecting and storing login information." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OpenID">OpenID</Tooltip> Connect (OIDC) as its authentication protocol, so you should be able to implement an integration to your application using standard libraries. The same situation applies when integrating Auth0 through [SAML](/docs/authenticate/single-sign-on/outbound-single-sign-on/configure-auth0-saml-identity-provider). All of Auth0's SDKs, libraries, and samples [are published on GitHub as free software](https://github.com/auth0/).

## Social identity providers

If you choose not to use Auth0 but want to keep using the same <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth">OAuth</Tooltip> <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+IDs">client IDs</Tooltip> and secrets for your social <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+providers">identity providers</Tooltip>, you will retain access to user information without needing to display new consent dialogs.

## Custom code

All of Auth0's custom code features (rules, custom database scripts, custom OAuth connections, and so on) run on a Node.js sandbox service. All libraries available on the sandbox service are also available on npm for use with standard Node.js code.
