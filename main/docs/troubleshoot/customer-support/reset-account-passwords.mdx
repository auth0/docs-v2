If you need to change your password or you have forgotten the password to your Auth0 account, in most cases, you can set a new password from the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>. Password resets cause Auth0 sessions to expire.

1. On the Auth0 account login screen, enter the email address associated with your account and click **Continue,** then choose **Forgot password?** at the next screen.
2. Confirm your email address and click **Continue** to submit. You will receive an email that provides further instructions on resetting your password.
3. If your request was successfully received, you'll see "Please check the email address [your email] for instructions to reset your password."

There are some special password reset circumstances:

* If you've enabled <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> and need an MFA reset for your admin account, contact [Auth0 Support](https://support.auth0.com).
* If you're using a social or enterprise account to log in to Auth0, reset your password with the appropriate <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip>.
* If you are an administrator trying to reset a user's password, there are two methods:

  + Use the interactive password reset flow with Universal Login or the Authentication API where the user receives an email with a link that opens the Auth0 password reset page to enter a new password.
  + Directly set the new password either using the Management API or the Dashboard.
