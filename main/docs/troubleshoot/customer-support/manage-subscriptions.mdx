If you have an Enterprise subscription plan, please refer to your Auth0 agreement for details.

If you have a Self-Service subscription plan, you can manage your subscription plan from the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>:

1. Go to [Teams > Settings](https://accounts.auth0.com) for Team-based subscriptions OR [Dashboard > Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/general) for Tenant-based subscriptions.
2. Select the **Subscription** tab. You can customize your plan options like monthly or yearly billing, the maximum number of supported monthly Active Users, and more.

Starting 1 December 2023, any Tenant-based subscription updates (except downgrades to Free) automatically converts to a Team-based subscription, allowing you benefits such as the ability to [link multiple tenants](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/tenant-management) within a single Self-Service subscription.

If you already have a Team-based subscription, instead of upgrading another tenant, you will have to instead link your tenant to the existing Team subscription.

## Upgrade subscriptions

You can upgrade your subscription from a Free plan to an Essentials or a Professional plan or from an Essentials to a Professional. To upgrade to an Enterprise plan, [contact Auth0 Sales](https://auth0.com/get-started?place=header&type=button&text=talk%20to%20sales).

1. On the **Subscription** tab, scroll to the panels describing the plan options.
2. Select a new plan and click **Checkout** to upgrade. If you do not have your billing information stored with Auth0, you'll need to provide it.
3. Click **Subscribe Now** to confirm your information and activate your new subscription.

## Downgrade to a Free subscription

1. On the **Subscription** tab, scroll to the box associated with the Free plan and click **Checkout**.
2. To confirm your subscription change, click **Subscribe Now**.
