description: Describes Auth0's tenant entity limit policy for subscribers.
title: Entity Limit Policy
---
Entities in Auth0 are tenant configuration elements such as Applications, Connections, Organizations, API <Tooltip tip="Resource Server: Server hosting protected resources. Resource servers accept and respond to protected resource requests." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=resource+servers">resource servers</Tooltip>, Permissions, Roles, Actions.

<Warning>

Entity limits are hard limits on entities that are enforced for the health of our platform; they are not a component of pricing, though they can differ for groups of pricing plans. Individual pricing plans have separate limitations, which refer to the entitlements like MAU and Enterprise Connections you receive when you subscribe to a given plan. (To learn what your pricing plan limitations are, see [Auth0 Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing/).)

</Warning>

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Any use of the term "unlimited" means that there are no hard limits, but the threshold is subject to system limitations set by Okta. Please reach out to support if you have any questions on these limits.

### Authorization Core Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Note that limitations on Permissions per user affect those assigned directly.

Technically, a user could have more Permissions than noted if the Permissions
were assigned to different Roles and then the Roles were assigned to the User.

| Entity                                   | Limit  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Refresh Token per User per Application   | 200    |

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If the <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Refresh+tokens">Refresh tokens</Tooltip> limit is reached and a new Refresh Token is
created, the system revokes or deletes the oldest token for that user in the
Application.

Revoked tokens and expired tokens do not count against the limit.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Actions and Actions Modules limits include both deployed and undeployed entities. When deleted, they no longer count toward the specific limit.

Actions Versions limits include both draft and active. Once the limit is reached, every additional version that is added will result in the oldest version being deleted.
