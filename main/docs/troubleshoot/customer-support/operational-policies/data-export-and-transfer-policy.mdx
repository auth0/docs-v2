## Export data

If you would like to export your data from Auth0 there are a several ways you can do this. Please note these tools do not export password hashes of your Auth0-hosted database users. You can still request this information by opening a [support ticket](https://support.auth0.com/). If you are opting to end your use of our service, see [Export Data](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/manage-subscriptions/export-data) for details.

### Use the Import/Export Extension

You can use our [Import/Export Extension](/docs/manage-users/user-migration/user-import-export-extension) to export nearly all data in your Auth0 tenant.

### Use the Management API

If you want to export certain sets of data programmatically, use the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> Bulk User Export endpoint.

## Transfer data

Auth0 will not transfer data from one Auth0 tenant to another. This applies to both Public Cloud and Private Cloud customers.

All data in your Auth0 tenant is always under your control and is available through the Management API at any time. The only information which is not available through the API are the password hashes of your Auth0-hosted database users and private keys, for security reasons.
