The following policy governs requests for billing mechanisms within the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>.

## Change billing email address

The billing email address is automatically set to the Team Owner (for Team based subscriptions) or Tenant Admin (for legacy Tenant based subscriptions) when upgrading to a paid plan.

As a Team Owner, you can modify the billing email address in [**Teams Dashboard > Setting > Payment & Billing**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/) tab for Team based subscriptions.

For legacy Tenant based subscriptions, as a Tenant Admin, you can modify the billing email address by visiting the [**Auth0 Dashboard > Settings > Payment & Billing**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/)**.**

## Credit card issues

To determine the reason for the failure, you must contact your credit card company. Billing issues can be triggered by a credit card reaching the limit or simply being rejected by the bank.

If your credit card charge fails, we automatically retry to charge it up to 4 times. If you fix the issue before the fourth failure (by entering new card information or by solving the issue with the bank), then the charge will go through and everything will work as expected. However, if the problem is not fixed prior to the fourth failure, all past due invoices will be manually initiated by Auth0. This means that you may be charged on an unexpected date.

## Cancel subscription

To cancel your subscription, downgrade it to the Free plan in the Auth0 Dashboard. To learn more, read [Downgrade or Cancel Subscriptions](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/manage-subscriptions/downgrade-or-cancel-subscriptions).

## Credits and refunds

If you cancel your subscription, you may be eligible for a credit or refund depending on the circumstances.

### Unused tenants

Tenants with minimal login transaction history may be eligible for a credit or refund. If we consider the usage of the tenant to not be minimal, Auth0 reserves the right to deny the credit or refund request.

Auth0 does not provide credits or refunds when a tenant on a paid plan is downgraded to another paid plan with fewer features.

### Unneeded self-service plans

Tenants with no recorded login transactions may be eligible for a credit or refund for any unused portion of the subscription within the last three (3) months.

### Request a credit or refund

You can request a credit or refund by contacting Okta Accounts Receivable at `ar@okta.com` and providing the following information:

* Subscription plan that your tenant was on before downgrade or cancellation.
* Date of downgrade or cancellation.
* Brief description of reason for downgrade or cancellation.

Requests must be submitted by a Tenant Administrator and are subject to evaluation and verification by Okta.

## Invoices

<Warning>

If you change your subscription plan, your invoices automatically migrate from a tenant-based billing model to the account-based model provided by [Auth0 Teams](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams).

Be aware of the following limitations before you migrate:

* **Invoice history**: After you migrate, all previous tenant-based invoices are unavailable. Download any old invoices that you need to record before migrating. If you need assistance, contact [Auth0 Support](https://support.auth0.com).
* **Tax IDs**: After an account-based invoice has been generated with a given Tax ID, it cannot be regenerated with a new Tax ID.
* **Invoice numbers**: Account-based invoice numbers are 11-digit alphanumeric values.

</Warning>

### Account-based

If you are using [Auth0 Teams](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams), your subscriptions and invoices are managed on the account level.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Only Team Owners can view invoices.

</Callout>

You can view invoices in the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Go to your [Team dashboard](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/tenant-management), and then select **Settings**.
2. Switch to the **Payment & Billing** view.
3. Locate the **Payment History** section.
4. Select an invoice from the list.

### Tenant-based

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Only Tenant Administrators can view invoices.

</Callout>

You can view invoices in the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Go to [Tenant Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant).
2. Switch to the **Payment & Billing** view.
3. Locate the **Payment History** section.
4. Select an invoice from the list.

## Receipts

You can obtain receipts by filing a ticket through our [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). Please note that you have to be a Tenant admin to do this request. Auth0 sends receipts to the email entered when you created your tenant. If you want to change this setting, please let us know through our [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com).

## Taxes

For certain regions, depending on tax laws and requirements, Auth0 is required to charge tax on invoices.

If your billing address is tax-eligible, you'll see the applicable tax added to your total during checkout. You will also see the applicable tax amount on all of your Auth0 invoices and receipts.

## Charges for users

You can choose a subscription plan based on your use case and the type of users who access your application. For information on subscriptions plans, see [Auth0 Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing/).

An active user is a user that has authenticated with a username/password combination, a <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> connection, or any social provider during a given calendar month. Auth0 counts users on a per-tenant basis. A user who logs in to multiple applications on the same tenant counts as one user.

You can scale the number of users as needed each month.

1. In the Dashboard, go to the upper right corner, click on your tenant name, and select **Settings** from the drop-down menu.
2. In the **Subscriptions** tab, select the option that best suits your needs.

## Combine billing for multiple tenants

If you have an Enterprise or upgraded Self service subscription, then use [Auth0 Teams](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams) to combine billing for multiple tenants under a single subscription.

To learn more about linking multiple tenants under a single subscription, read [Link Multiple Tenants to a Single Subscription](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants/child-tenants).

## Convert tenant from free trial to any other plan

1. In the Dashboard, go to the upper right corner, click on your tenant name, and select **Settings** from the drop-down menu.
2. In the **Subscriptions** tab, select the plan that best suits your needs.
