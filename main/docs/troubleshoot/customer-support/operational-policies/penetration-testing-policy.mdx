If you have a paid Auth0 subscription, you may conduct a security test of your application involving Auth0 infrastructure (e.g. `your-tenant.auth0.com`) with prior approval.

## Submit penetration testing request

To conduct a security test, please notify us in advance via the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). Auth0 requires at least 7 days notice prior to your test's planned start date.

If the test is isolated to your infrastructure (that is, there will be no testing of Auth0 services), you do not need to notify Auth0.

### Information required

Please provide the following information in the support ticket when requesting approval for testing:

* The specific dates/times of the test and timezone. Tests are not allowed during a change freeze period. To learn more, read the change freeze penetration testing policy below.
* Scope and purpose of the test
* IP address(es) the test will come from
* Tooling that is planned to be used
* Request per second (the test must be conformant with the [Rate Limit Policy](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy))
* The Auth0 tenant(s) involved
* Two contacts - phone number and email -Â  who will be available during the entire test period in case we need to contact you. If we have any questions, we will make a reasonable attempt to contact you. If you cannot be reached, we reserve the right to take measures to protect the service, which may include shutting down or blocking your tenant and/or the source of the intrusion traffic.

## Change freeze policy

<Warning>

Penetration tests are not allowed during change freeze periods.

</Warning>

To view the currently scheduled change freeze periods, read [Change Freeze Policy](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/change-freeze-policy).

## Test requirements

Auth0 requires that:

* The test be restricted to only your tenant
* The test requests per second must not exceed rates defined in our [Rate Limit Policy](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy)
* You disclose any suspected findings to the Auth0 Security team for explanation/discussion

## Reporting Identified Vulnerabilities

To report any identified vulnerabilities, please read the [Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.okta.com/vulnerability-reporting-policy/).

## Restrictions

* You may not conduct any [load testing](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/load-testing-policy) (such as Denial of Service testing) per the load testing policy.
* You may not conduct any penetration testing targeting our management dashboard. Management and Authentication APIs are allowed.
* You may not conduct any penetration testing targeting tenants that we have not approved.

## Private Cloud customers

Private Cloud customers should also request permission to run a penetration test via the Auth0 support center. Please include the information listed above with your support request.
