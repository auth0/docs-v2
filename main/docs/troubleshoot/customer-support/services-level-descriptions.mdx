Here is a summary of the key elements of Auth0’s Service Level Agreement (SLA) for both Enterprise Public Cloud and Enterprise Private Cloud deployments of the Auth0 platform. Please contact [Auth0 Sales](https://auth0.com/get-started?place=documentation%20post&type=link&text=contact%20auth0%20sales) for additional information.

The average availability of certain core services of the Auth0 platform for each month will be at least 99.99%. If Auth0 fails to meet its availability service level during any given calendar month, you may request a service level credit within 5 business days of the event.

Auth0 will provide you with credit as described in the table below. If any credits are not used upon the expiration of your subscription, then we will apply the credits to any other fees or expenses you owe us. If there are no such other fees or expenses then we will refund the credit amount.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Availability Level</strong></th>
<th><strong>Service Level Credit</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>98.50% - 99.98%</td>
<td>5% of the Monthly Subscription Fee*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>97.00% - 98.49%</td>
<td>10% of the Monthly Subscription Fee*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt; 97.00%</td>
<td>20% of the Monthly Subscription Fee*</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

\*Credits are applicable to the calendar month in which the service disruption occurred.

If you experience an event that you believe brings you below the aforementioned Availability Levels, please contact your Auth0 Technical Account Manager. If you are a Basic or Silver Success Plan customer, contact your Auth0 Sales Representative or Account Executive.

If you require a [Private instance](/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-private-cloud) of Auth0, please contact [Auth0 Sales](https://auth0.com/get-started?place=documentation%20post&type=link&text=contact%20auth0%20sales) for additional information.
