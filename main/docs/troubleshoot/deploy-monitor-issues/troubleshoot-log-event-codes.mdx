## Post-login Actions and Social connections

If you have configured a post-login Action and a Social connection (such as Facebook) on your tenant, you may encounter the following issue.

When a user signs up on a Social connection and your post-login Action fails for that authentication flow, Auth0 logs a "Failed Signup" (`fs`) event. However, Auth0 does create a user profile for this user.

Subsequently, when the user logs in on that Social connection, Auth0 logs a "Success Login" (`s`) event but not a "Success Signup" (`ss`) event.
