Auth0 is deprecating the `enabled_clients` field from Management API’s [Get All Connections](/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections), [Get Connections](/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections-by-id), and [Update a Connection](/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-connections-by-id). Auth0 customers can retrieve enabled clients on a connection by using the [Get enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connection-clients)endpoint. To update clients already established on a connection, use the [Update enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-clients).

To prepare for this change and ensure your integrations continue to function smoothly, review the steps below to verify your affected status and migrate to the new endpoints.

To learn more about migration timelines, review the entry on [Deprecations and Migrations](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations).

## Verify affected tenants

Tenants created before January 7, 2026, can continue to access the deprecated `enabled_clients` field until the migration deadline. Tenants created on or after this date may lose access to the field as part of the deprecation rollout.

After the initial rollout, this section will offer detailed instructions on how to identify affected tenants, regardless of their creation date.

## Update your integrations

For applications and integrations using the impacted connection endpoints to retrieve (`GET`) or update (`PATCH`) the `enabled_clients` field, you must modify them to use the dedicated client management endpoints:

* **To Read:** [Get enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connection-clients).
* **To Write:** [Update enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-clients).

## Update SDKs and Tools
Some SDKs that expose Management API functionality are still pending an update. Ensure you are using the versions below (or newer) that support the new endpoints:
* [node-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/node-auth0): `4.25.0+`
* [go-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/go-auth0/): `1.21.0+`
* [auth0-java](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-java): `2.21.0+`
* [Auth0 Deploy CLI](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-cli-tool) / [Auth0 Terraform Provider](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/auth0-terraform-provider): You must use the latest available version to guarantee the tool uses the dedicated endpoints.

## Opt-Out (Finalize Migration)
Once you ensure that integrations no longer depend on the deprecated behavior, you should configure the tenant to explicitly opt out.
* **Why Opt-Out Early?** This allows you to control the exact timeline at which a given tenant switches to the new behavior. In the event of any unexpected situation, you can quickly revert the toggle to restore the original behavior.
* **How to Opt-Out:** Navigate to **[Auth0 Dashboard > Tenant Settings > Advanced](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/#/tenant/advanced).**  Under Migrations, toggle off the **Legacy Management of Connection's Enabled Clients** option.

The migration toggle rollout is ongoing. It is expected that the setting rolls out to Public Cloud tenants by January 21, 2026, and to Private Cloud tenants over the subsequent weeks.
