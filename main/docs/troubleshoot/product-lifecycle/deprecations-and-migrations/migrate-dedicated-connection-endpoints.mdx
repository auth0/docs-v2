Auth0 is deprecating the `enable_clients` field from Management API’s [Get All Connections](/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections), [Get Connections](/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections-by-id), and [Update a Connection](/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-connections-by-id) endpoints. Auth0 customers can retrieve enable clients on a connection by using the [Get enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connection-clients)endpoint. To update clients already established on a connection, use the [Update enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-clients).

To prepare for this change and ensure your integrations continue to function smoothly, review the steps below to verify your affected status and migrate to the new endpoints.

To learn more, review the entry on [Deprecations and Migrations](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/deprecations-and-migrations).

## Verify affected tenants

To confirm if a tenant is using the `enable_clients` field, you can check via the Dashboard or the API.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
This migration setting rolls out to **Public Cloud** tenants within one week of this notice, and to **Private Cloud** tenants over the coming weeks.
</Callout>

### Auth0 Dashboard

1. Navigate to **[Auth0 Dashboard > Tenant Settings > Advanced](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/#/tenant/advanced)**. 
2. Scroll down to the Migration section. 
3. Look for the **Legacy Management of Connection's Enabled Clients** toggle.
      	A. If the toggle is **on**, your tenant supports the legacy behavior and you should plan to migrate.
    	B. If the toggle if **off**, make a call to the Management API as instructed in the next section to verify your status.

### Management API

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
To make a call to Auth0’s Management API, you need an [access token](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens/get-management-api-access-tokens-for-production).
</Callout>

Call the [Get a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connections-by-id) endpoint to retrieve a connection by identifier:

```bash
curl -L -g 'https://{YOUR_AUTH0_TENANT}/api/v2/connections/:id' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_TOKEN
```

If the response body includes the `enabled_clients` field with Client IDs similar to the example response below, you are using the legacy behavior:

```bash
{"id":"YOUR_CONNECTION_ID","strategy":"google-oauth2","name":"google-oauth2","is_domain_connection":false,"authentication":{"active":true},"connected_accounts":{"active":false},"enabled_clients":["YOUR_CLIENT_ID1", "YOUR_CLIENT_ID2", "YOUR_CLIENT_ID3"]}
```

If your connection supports a single enabled application, the `enable_clients` array contains a single Client ID. If your connection supports multiple applications, your array contains all Client IDs on that connection.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
For connections with a very large number of enabled clients, this request can be resource-intensive. Please perform this check manually; do not script high-frequency calls to this endpoint.
</Callout>

## Update your integrations

For applications and integrations using the impacted connection endpoints to retrieve (`GET`) or update (`PATCH`) the `enabled_clients` field, you must modify them to use the dedicated client management endpoints:

* **To Read:** [Get enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/get-connection-clients).
* **To Write:** [Update enabled clients for a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/connections/patch-clients).

## Update SDKs and Tools
Some SDKs that expose Management API functionality are still pending an update. Ensure you are using the versions below (or newer) that support the new endpoints:
* [node-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/node-auth0): `4.25.0+`
* [go-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/go-auth0/): `1.21.0+`
* [auth0-java](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-java): `2.21.0+`
* [Auth0 Deploy CLI](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-cli-tool) / [Auth0 Terraform Provider](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/auth0-terraform-provider): You must use the latest available version to guarantee the tool uses the dedicated endpoints.

## Opt-Out (Finalize Migration)
Once you ensure that integrations no longer depend on the deprecated behavior, you should configure the tenant to explicitly opt out.
* **Why Opt-Out Early?** This allows you to control the exact timeline at which a given tenant switches to the new behavior. In the event of any unexpected situation, you can quickly revert the toggle to restore the original behavior.
* **How to Opt-Out:** Navigate to **[Auth0 Dashboard > Tenant Settings > Advanced](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/#/tenant/advanced).**  Under Migrations, toggle off the **Legacy Management of Connection's Enabled Clients** option.
