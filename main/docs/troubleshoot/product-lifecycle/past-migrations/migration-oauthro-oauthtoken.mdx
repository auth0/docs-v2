'twitter:title': Migrate Your Resource Owner Password Flow
---
Support for <Tooltip tip="Resource Owner: Entity (such as a user or application) capable of granting access to a protected resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=resource+owner">resource owner</Tooltip> password was added to `/oauth/token`. Usage of the `/oauth/ro` endpoint was deprecated on 08 July 2017. The `/oauth/ro` endpoint was previously used to exchange a one-time password (OTP) received by the end-user email or SMS for an <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+token">ID token</Tooltip> and an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip>. Auth0 has implemented a new API that replaces `/oauth/ro` for this use case and we recommend that you migrate to using the new endpoint.

## Features affected

This change affects you if you use the [Resource Owner Password Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/resource-owner-password-flow)(sometimes called Resource Owner Password Grant or ROPG) and call `/oauth/ro` directly without the use of any Auth0 libraries or SDKs. Auth0 libraries such as Lock or Auth0.js have been updated to stop using `/oauth/ro` internally. If you use the lock-<Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=passwordless">passwordless</Tooltip> library, you can now use Passwordless Mode in Lock instead.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

When a user's `/oauth/ro` based access token has expired, Auth0 forces them to reauthenticate (forced logout required) because the `/oauth/ro` refresh token cannot be used to call `/oauth/token` for a new access token. All currently logged in user's must log in again during an `/oauth/ro` to `/oauth/token` migration.

## Actions

### Change requests

Previously, the payload of a request to `/oauth/ro` looked similar to this:

```json lines
{
  "grant_type": "password",
  "client_id": "123",
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "A3ddj3w", 
  "connection": "my-database-connection",
  "scope": "openid email favorite_color offline_access",
  "device": "my-device-name"
}
```






The new implementation contains the following changes:

* The endpoint to execute token exchanges is now `/oauth/token`.
* Auth0's own grant type is used to authenticate users from a specific connection (or realm).
* Auth0 supports the standard OIDC scopes, along with the scopes which you have defined in your custom API.
* A scope that doesn't fit in one of these categories, such as the above `favorite_color`, is no longer a valid scope.
* The `device` parameter is removed.
* The `audience` parameter is optional.

Here is an example of the payload of a request to `/oauth/token`:

```json lines
{
  "grant_type": "http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/password-realm",
  "client_id": "123",
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "A3ddj3w",
  "realm": "my-database-connection",
  "scope": "openid email offline_access",
  "audience": "https://api.example.com"
}
```






* The grant type is specified here as `password-realm`, rather than the standard `password`.
* The parameters `client_id`, `username`, and `password` are unchanged.
* The `realm` is included because we are using Password Realm grant type, and replaces the `connection` parameter from previous calls.
* The `scope` parameter is mostly the same, but does not accept non-OIDC values.
* The `audience` parameter can be added, indicating the API <Tooltip tip="Audience: Unique identifier of the audience for an issued token. Named aud in a token, its value contains the ID of either an application (Client ID) for an ID Token or an API (API Identifier) for an Access Token." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=audience">audience</Tooltip> the token will be intended for.

### Response changes

Responses from `/oauth/ro` were similar in format to the following:

```json lines
{
  "access_token": "SlAV32hkKG",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "id_token": "eyJ..."
}
```






* The returned access token is valid for calling the `/userinfo` endpoint (provided that the API specified by the `audience` param uses RS256 as <Tooltip tip="Signing Algorithm: Algorithm used to digitally sign tokens to ensure the token has not been tampered with." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=signing+algorithm">signing algorithm</Tooltip>) and optionally the custom API if one was specified.
* The ID token will be forcibly signed using RS256 if requested by a <Tooltip tip="Public Client: Client (application) that cannot hold credentials securely. Examples include a native desktop or mobile application and a JavaScript-based client-side web application (such as a single-page app (SPA))." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=public+client">public client</Tooltip>.
* A <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Refresh+Token">Refresh Token</Tooltip> will be returned only if the `offline_access` scope was granted and the API has **Allow offline access** set.

Here is an example of the OIDC conformant response from `/oauth/token`:

```json lines
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "8xLOxBtZp8",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "id_token": "eyJ..."
}
```






### Verify migration

1. Once you have migrated your codebase and are sure that your apps are not calling the endpoint, go to the [Dashboard > Tenant Settings > Advanced](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/advanced).
2. Scroll down to **Migrations** and toggle off **Legacy** `/oauth/ro` **Endpoint**. Turning off this switch disables the deprecated endpoint for your tenant, preventing it from being used.

If turning this switch off results in failed logins, this is a sign that you have yet to completely remove all instances of legacy code from your applications.

Once migrations have been successfully performed in production environments, the switch can be toggled off and left off, to ensure that the deprecated features can no longer be used.
