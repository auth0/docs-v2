   * Set **Content Format** to JSON Lines.
10. Click **Save**.
11. Go to **Extensions > Installed Extensions** and disable your **Auth0 Logs to Papertrail** extension.

## Splunk

Use the [Splunk Integration](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/splunk-log-streaming) available on the Auth0 Marketplace. Make sure you disable your Auth0 Logs to Splunk extension:

## Logentries

Currently, there are no instructions for migrating from the Logs to Logentries extension to log streams.

## Segment

1. Login to your Auth0 dashboard
2. Within **Extensions > Installed Extensions**, find your Segment extension.
3. Take note of your **Write Key**, as you’ll need it for your new log stream to Segment.
4. Disable your Segment extension.
5. Take note of the UTC timestamp of the last log you have received in Segment. Knowing that timestamp will allow you to create your new stream while avoiding duplicate logs in Segment.
6. Go to **Monitoring > Log Streams**, and create a new Segment log stream. Enter your **Write Key** in the appropriate field and the timestamp you noted in the **Start From** section.
7. Create the stream

## Mixpanel

1. Login to your Mixpanel account, open your **Project Settings**. Take note of your **Project ID** and **Data Residency** (the region).
2. Mixpanel no longer recommends using your project token for importing events and recommends using the service account mechanism. Within the **Project Settings** page, select **Service Accounts**, and create a new service account with admin or owner permissions. Take note of the credentials.
3. Log in to your Auth0 dashboard.
4. In **Monitoring > Log Streams**, create a new Mixpanel stream. Enter the project id, region, service account credentials and create the stream.
5. Don’t forget to deactivate your old extension. Go to **Extensions > Installed Extensions** and disable the **Auth0 Logs to Mixpanel extension**.

## AppInsights

1. Set up an [Azure EventGrid Log Stream](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/azure-log-streaming) or leverage your existing EventGrid stream.
2. Follow the [instructions posted by Azure](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/auth0-log-stream-app-insights__;!!PwKahg!9T9C3qhBRgQQHChQkQqnmHDDnX99yWJ4W8F4rLVs6qrwwbnFCY3JcCfF486d1DLqRFEghVnJZ9gJnronDv0$) to set a destination for the log events.
3. Logs may be transformed differently through Log Streaming. Please reference the deprecated [Log Extenstion code](https://github.com/auth0-extensions/auth0-logs-to-provider/blob/master/server/lib/senders/appinsights.js) for further details

Notable transformations done to the logs include:

* The appInsight client is overwritten:

  + Sets a custom time equivalent to the log time
  + OS and OS version to be equivalent to the log information
  + Device type tag to hold information on whether the log originated from a mobile source
  + IP address tag be equivalent to the log information
  + user id, account id, user agent and auth user id tags to be equivalent to the logs
* The record is cleaned up to delete the following properties if empty:

  + ip
  + user_id
  + user_name
  + connection
  + client_name
  + description
* The record isMobile property is altered to contain either a yes or no string
* The record details property is altered to be a string
* The record details property is truncated to 8185 characters

## Azure Blob Storage

1. Set up an [Azure EventGrid Log Stream](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/azure-log-streaming) or leverage your existing EventGrid stream.
2. Follow the [instructions posted by Azure](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/auth0-log-stream-blob-storage__;!!PwKahg!9T9C3qhBRgQQHChQkQqnmHDDnX99yWJ4W8F4rLVs6qrwwbnFCY3JcCfF486d1DLqRFEghVnJZ9gJ5k9lKMM$) to set a destination for the log events.
3. Logs may be transformed differently through Log Streaming. Please reference the deprecated [Log Extenstion code](https://github.com/auth0-extensions/auth0-logs-to-provider/blob/master/server/lib/senders/blobstorage.js) for further details

Notable transformations done to the logs include:

* The record `type_code` and `type` is adjusted. `Type` is the human-readable description of the `type_code`
* Record `os`, `os_version`, `device` and `device_version` is adjusted if the record contains `user_agent` information
