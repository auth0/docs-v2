As of June 21, 2023, Auth0 will no longer support connecting to Oracle Databases from Node.js in Extensibility features. Auth0 previously supported connecting to Oracle Databases via the `oracledb` Node.js module.

## Affected workflows

Review your Extensibility features for code that contains `require(oracledb)` orÂ  `require('oracledb@4.2.0')`.

Review the following flows or features that allow extensibility code for references to [oracledb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oracledb):

* [Hooks](/docs/customize/hooks)
* [Rules](/docs/customize/rules)
* [Custom Database Scripts](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/create-db-connection#create-database-action-scripts)
* [Custom Social Connections](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/oauth2)

## Recommended updates

There is no official planned replacement for this feature. Auth0 recommends replacing the `oracledb` logic to a separate service within your own infrastructure. After you create the service in your infrastructure, you can use an Extensibility function to make an HTTP request to trigger the Oracle Database logic.

To learn more about how to implement the `oracledb` module in your own infrastructure, review the [OracleDB Quickstart guide](https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html#quickstart).

For example, in a Custom Database Login script using `oracledb`, remove the function that calls `oracledb` with a generic HTTP client to capture the response.
