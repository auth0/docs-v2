When Auth0 features are deprecated, there may be errors or notices in the tenant logs that show up to indicate that your applications are using the deprecated features. This guide will provide assistance with searching your logs for deprecation-related messages as well as explanations of potential causes and resolutions for particular items.

There are two different ways to search for warning messages showing usage of deprecated features: The Dashboard or the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>. Note that in either case, the [log retention period](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs) is governed by the subscription level of your account.

See [Search Logs for Deprecation Errors](/docs/troubleshoot/basic-issues/search-logs-for-deprecation-errors) for details.

## Deprecation log messages

### Legacy Lock API

**Log entry**: `up-idp-initiated`

**Error Message:** "Legacy Lock API: This feature is being deprecated. Please refer to our documentation to learn how to migrate your application."

**Cause**: Tenant log entries regarding the Legacy Lock API may include the referrer and information about the SDK used.

**Resolution**: Use this information to see if any of your applications use outdated libraries.

### SSOdata endpoint

**Log entry**: `ssodata`

**Error Message:** "SSOdata endpoint: This feature is being deprecated. Please refer to our documentation to learn how to migrate your application."

**Cause**: Either calling the `/ssodata` endpoint directly or using old versions of embedded Lock or Auth0.js SDK to call a function which called the `/ssodata` endpoint.

**Resolution**: Update Lock SDK or Auth0.js SDK to the most recent version.
