Ensure that you are on current versions of your technology stack. If you're using an older version of a programming language or library consider updating to the current version.

* Check the [Auth0 support matrix](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/product-support-matrix) to see if the language or library versions you're using is supported.
* If there's a problem in one environment (such as development) but not another (such as production), compare the versions of the technology stack across the two environments.
* If not, upgrade your technology stack and browser to the latest versions and test again before creating a support request.

## Check the scope of the issue

Testing on different browsers, platforms, locations, and users can help narrow down the source of a problem when it occurs. Perform the following tests and review the [logs in your Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) after each test for more information.

See [the Monitoring page](/docs/deploy-monitor/monitor) for more details on each of the log events that can help you troubleshoot issues.

</Callout>

### Test with different browsers

* Does the issue happen with all browsers or just some?
* Test in a new incognito or private browser session (no previous state).
* Upgrade to the latest browser version and re-test.
* Turn off browser plugins and re-test to see if a plug-in contributes to the issue.

### Test with different users

* Does the issue occur for all users or just some?
* If some, is there a pattern? Such as location, connection, or role?

### Test with different connections (if possible)

* Does the issue happen with all connections or just one?

### Test with different client applications (if you have more than one)

* Does the issue happen with all clients or just one?

### Test across different environments

* Try the development, staging, and production environments of your application(s).
* Try across different Auth0 tenants to see if any differences.

## Check if the issue is consistent or intermittent

* If the issue is consistent, note the steps to reliably duplicate the issue.
* If the issue intermittent, note any pattern that might cause it.
* Is this an issue with a new setup, or did it work before and is now broken?

  + If it just broke, what changes were made?
  + Does undoing the changes fix the issue?

## Issues that affect only one or a few users

* [Check the user's profile](/docs/troubleshoot/authentication-issues/check-user-profiles), browser, or device for any issues.
* Check to see if it happens in all browsers for the affected users (indicating a data issue) or just certain types of browsers (indicating a browser-specific issue).
* Check to see if the browser has enabled JavaScript and cookies.
* Check that the caps lock key is disabled.
* If the user is using a mobile device, check to see if there's any software that might impact authentication and/or authorization (such as not running some type of required software).
* Check to see if the user can access some of the application's key URLs, such as the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip>'s <Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Single+Sign-on">Single Sign-on</Tooltip> (SSO) URL (indicating a network connectivity issue).

## Issues that occur after go-live (worked before, then stopped working)

* Check if any recent changes to your application or any APIs you call?
* Check if any recent network changes (load balancer, firewall, proxy config changes).
* Check if any recent infrastructure changes (e.g. credentials for LDAP or DB servers?)
* Check for any patches or updates to applications, infrastructure, or technology stacks.
* Check that all your servers are running NTP and have accurate time sync
* Check if any of your certificates have expired.
* Check with owners of any remote identity providers if anything changed.

  + Check network connectivity to any remote identity providers.
* Check notifications in <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+dashboard">Auth0 dashboard</Tooltip>/migrations - any changes you overlooked?
* Check Auth0 change log - any recent configuration changes related to your issue?
* Check if any component in the technology stack has been updated or patched recently?
