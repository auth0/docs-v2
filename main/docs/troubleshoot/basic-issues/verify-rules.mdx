<Warning>

The End of Life (EOL) date of Rules and Hooks will be **November 18, 2026**, and they are no longer available to new tenants created as of **October 16, 2023**. Existing tenants with active Hooks will retain Hooks product access through end of life.

We highly recommend that you use Actions to extend Auth0. With Actions, you have access to rich type information, inline documentation, and public `npm` packages, and can connect external integrations that enhance your overall extensibility experience. To learn more about what Actions offer, read [Understand How Auth0 Actions Work](/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

To help with your migration, we offer guides that will help you [migrate from Rules to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-rules-to-actions) and [migrate from Hooks to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate/migrate-from-hooks-to-actions). We also have a dedicated [Move to Actions](https://auth0.com/extensibility/movetoactions) page that highlights feature comparisons, [an Actions demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesFSY1klrI), and other resources to help you on your migration journey.

To read more about the Rules and Hooks deprecation, read our blog post: [Preparing for Rules and Hooks End of Life](https://auth0.com/blog/preparing-for-rules-and-hooks-end-of-life/).

<Warning>

We expose IPv6 addresses in our public endpoints (e.g., `travel0.us.auth0.com`). If a request arrives from a machine that supports IPv6, then the `context.request.ip` property will contain an IPv6 address. If you perform manual IP address manipulation, we suggest you use the [ipaddr.js@1.9.0 library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipaddr.js/v/1.9.0).

</Warning>

Failures in a rule can often cause authentication issues. Perform the following checks to see if rules could be behind your issue.

* Turn rules off and see if the issue still occurs.
* Check that your rules catch all possible errors that might be returned. Uncaught errors could cause failures.
* Check that your rules are calling the `callback` function only once for each logical branch in your code.
* Add `console.log()` statements to your rules to debug and check state. For example: `console.log(“output = “ + some_variable);`.
* Click **Debug Rule** in the Dashboard to view the output from your `console.log` statements.
* View the output in the Real-time Webtask Logs to get more information about your rules’ execution.
