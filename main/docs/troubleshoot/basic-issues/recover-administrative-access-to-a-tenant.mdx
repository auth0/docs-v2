If you cannot access the administrator account for your tenant, you have options for recovery.

If an existing administrator leaves your organization without delegating access to another team member, try the steps below before contacting Auth0 support.

These solutions will not work if the employee was the only admin on the tenant and MFA protected the account.

</Callout>

1. Check the email alias of the former admin. If you have access to the inbox, such as through Google Workspace, request a password reset for the user and reset the password for the tenant account.
2. Check for another admin on the tenant. This admin can remove the previous employee account and add a new admin. Auth0 recommends you have multiple admins on a tenant.

If you still cannot gain access to the tenant, create a support request with Auth0. Our support team will verify tenant ownership and grant access.Â To learn more, read [Open and Manage Support Tickets](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/open-and-manage-support-tickets).
