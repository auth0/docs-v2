In some cases, renewing tokens with silent authentication does not work as expected with the latest version of the Safari browser. Recent versions of the Safari browser introduced a new feature called [Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP)](https://webkit.org/blog/category/privacy/). ITP is designed to prevent websites from tracking user activity across multiple websites. By default, ITP is active. You can determine if the Safari version you are using has ITP by going to the **Preferences > Privacy** tab and seeing if the **Prevent cross-site tracking** option is checked.

## ITP and browser behavior

Enabling ITP causes the browser to behave as if you had disabled third-party cookies in the browser, which makes it impossible to obtain a new token without displaying anything to the user. This is akin to the way <Tooltip tip="OpenID: Open standard for authentication that allows applications to verify users' identities without collecting and storing login information." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OpenID">OpenID</Tooltip> Connect (OIDC) uses iframes for handling [sessions](/docs/manage-users/sessions) in SPAs.

In the SPA SDK (which is our recommendation) `getTokenSilently` performs [silent authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/configure-silent-authentication) unless you configure the SDK to use rotating <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=refresh+tokens">refresh tokens</Tooltip>.

## Workarounds

Recent advancements in user privacy controls in browsers adversely impact the user experience by preventing access to third-party cookies. You can use [Refresh Token Rotation](/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/refresh-token-rotation) as an alternative that provides a secure method for using refresh tokens in SPAs while providing end-users with seamless access to resources without the disruption in UX caused by browser privacy technology like ITP.

Alternatively, you can work around the issues posed by ITP by using Auth0's [custom domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains) functionality, particularly if the <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domain">custom domain</Tooltip> lives on a subdomain of the application's website domain. For example, if your application is hosted on **example.com**, the custom domain would need to be of the format **subdomain.example.com**.

## ITP debug mode

[Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) offers an "Intelligent Tracking Prevention Debug Mode" that you can use to troubleshoot ITP issues. You can find instructions on how to debug ITP in [this blog post from WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/8387/itp-debug-mode-in-safari-technology-preview-62/).

**NOTE**: The instructions mention how to permanently classify a custom domain as having tracking abilities for testing purposes. In later versions of Safari Technology Preview, though, the domain to store the User Defaults for this setting changed from `com.apple.SafariTechnologyPreview` to `com.apple.WebKit.Networking`. If you are having trouble with the commands mentioned in the instructions, try these:

* Classify a site as having tracking abilities:
  `defaults write com.apple.WebKit.Networking ResourceLoadStatisticsManualPrevalentResource example.com`
* Inspect the setting:
  `defaults read com.apple.WebKit.Networking ResourceLoadStatisticsManualPrevalentResource`
* Delete the setting:
  `defaults delete com.apple.WebKit.Networking ResourceLoadStatisticsManualPrevalentResource`

You will need to restart Safari Technology Preview every time you make changes for the settings to take effect.
