1. Is user profile information correct at the source (authorization server)?
2. Generate and check the [HAR file](/docs/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-tools/generate-and-analyze-har-files), look for an `id_token`.

   <Warning>

   Before sharing a HAR file with anyone (including Auth0), ensure that you remove or obfuscate all sensitive data, such as:

   * Confidential user information
   * Personal identifiable information (PII)
   * Confidential application information

   To learn more, read the following articles on [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com):

   * [Sanitizing HTTP Traces](https://community.auth0.com/t/sanitizing-http-traces/119488)
   * [How to Sanitize an HTTP Trace File Automatically](https://community.auth0.com/t/how-to-sanitize-a-http-trace-file-automatically/120583)
   * [How to Manually Redact Sensitive Information](https://community.auth0.com/t/how-to-manually-redact-sensitive-information/122554)
   * [HAR File is Too Large to Upload to the Support Case](https://community.auth0.com/t/har-file-is-too-large-to-upload-to-the-support-case/122488)
   </Warning>
3. Decode the `id_token` at [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) to see if it has the correct information.
4. Check any custom database scripts or rule logic.
5. Check if you called `/tokeninfo` endpoint and have a custom domain configured within Auth0. If so, you need to use `/userinfo` endpoint instead
6. Check if you called `/userinfo` endpoint properly. You should pass an access token. You should call this endpoint with the default Auth0 domain even if the tenant has a custom domain enabled.
7. Check if you specified the correct [scope](/docs/get-started/apis/scopes) to get an Access Token.
