In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to export user data in Auth0 to a CSV file then import it into Salesforce using the Data Import Wizard. To review system requirements, visit the Salesforce article [Data Import Wizard](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=data_import_wizard.htm).

## Create a user data file

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Salesforce accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

At the top in the **Fields** section, provide a **User Field** and **Column Name** for each user attribute to include in the export. For example:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>User Field</th>
<th>Column Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>email</code></td>
<td>Email Address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>created_at</code></td>
<td>Created At</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>given_name</code></td>
<td>First Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>family_name</code></td>
<td>Last Name</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

After adding the user fields, click on the **Export Users** button to start the export. Once the export is complete, download the CSV file to use in the following section.

## Import a user data file

Different account types may require addition steps for successful import. Take a moment to review the Salesforce article [Prepare Your Data for Import](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=import_prepare.htm). For additional instructions, visit [Salesforce: Import Data with the Data Import Wizard](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=import_with_data_import_wizard.htm).

Before you begin, make sure your Salesforce account has the required [user permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=faq_import_general_permissions.htm) to import records.

To import your CSV file into Salesforce, follow these steps:

1. Login to [Salesforce](https://login.salesforce.com/).
2. Navigate to **Setup** and open the **Data Import Wizard**.
3. Click **Launch Wizard**.
4. Configure the import and select your CSV file to upload using the fields provided.
5. Click **Next**.
6. On the **Edit Field Mapping** page, map your CSV file's data fields to Salesforce data fields. Click **Next** to proceed.
7. After you've verified the information on the **Review** page, click **Start Import**.
8. Check out the **Recent Import Jobs** tab on the **Data Import Wizard** home page for updates on the status of your import.

That's it! You successfully imported your Auth0 users into Salesforce.
