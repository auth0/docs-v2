In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to export user data in Auth0 to a CSV file then import it into Adobe Campaign with the [Adobe Campaign Import Wizard](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/importing-data.html).

## Create a user data file

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard, and opening the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Adobe Campaign accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

At the top in the **Fields** section, provide a **User Field** and **Column Name** for each user attribute to include in the export. For example:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>User Field</th>
<th>Column Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>email</code></td>
<td>Email Address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>created_at</code></td>
<td>Created At</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>given_name</code></td>
<td>First Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>family_name</code></td>
<td>Last Name</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

After adding the user fields, click on the **Export Users** button to start the export. Once the export is complete, download the CSV file to use in the following section.

## Import a user data file

Before you get started, you can find more information by visiting [Adobe Campaign Documentation: Importing Data](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/importing-data.html).

Log in to your Adobe Campaign client dashboard and navigate to **Profiles and Targets > Jobs**. Create a new import job by clicking the **Create** button and selecting **New Import**.

A new **Import Wizard** window should open. On the **Template Selection** step you can set your import parameters.

Once you've configured your import parameters, click the **Next** button to continue.

On the **File to Import** step upload the user data CSV file you exported from Auth0 in the previous section. Click the **Next** button to proceed to **Field Mapping**.

Next, map the export file schema to your Adobe Campaign database schema. Check that the field names and field types are correct, then click the **Next** button.

Complete the remaining configuration steps by defining your data reconciliation mode and selecting a folder, list, or service for the users being imported.

Finally, begin the import by clicking the **Start** button on the **Data Import Execution** window.

That's it! You successfully imported your Auth0 users into Adobe Campaign.
