In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to export user data in Auth0 to a CSV file then import it into Salesforce Marketing Cloud using Email Studio.

To read more, review the Salesforce article [Get Started Checklist for Email Studio](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=mc_es_get_started_with_email_studio.htm&type=5).

## Create a user data file

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Salesforce Marketing Cloud accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

At the top in the **Fields** section, provide a **User Field** and **Column Name** for each user attribute to include in the export. For example:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>User Field</th>
<th>Column Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>email</code></td>
<td>Email Address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>created_at</code></td>
<td>Created At</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>given_name</code></td>
<td>First Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>family_name</code></td>
<td>Last Name</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

After adding the user fields, click on the **Export Users** button to start the export. Once the export is complete, download the CSV file to use in the following section.

## Import a user data file

Before you begin, make sure your Salesforce account has the required user permissions to import records. Also, you should take a moment to review the steps in the Salesforce article [Email Studio: Import Subscribers](https://help.marketingcloud.com/en/documentation/exacttarget/subscribers/subscribers_for_interactive_marketing_hub/imports/importing_subscribers/) along with [What permissions do I need to import records](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=faq_import_general_permissions.htm).

To import your CSV file into Salesforce Marketing Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Salesforce Marketing Cloud and open **Email Studio**.
2. Navigate to **Subscribers > Lists**.
3. Choose the list to import to and select the **Import** action.
4. After the import wizard's introduction, select your CSV file as the **Upload Source** and select CSV as the **Data Format**. Enter the remaining settings and click **Next**.
5. In the **Map Attributes** dialog, map your CSV file's data fields to the correct data fields. When you've finished your mappings click **Next**.
6. After you've verified your mappings in the **Confirmed Mappings** dialog, click **Begin** to start the import.

That's it! You successfully imported your Auth0 users into Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
