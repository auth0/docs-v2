The URI that the user is redirected to after a successful password reset depends on all the following conditions:

1. whether your tenant uses Universal or Classic Login, and
2. whether you generate a password change ticket directly via the Management API, or
3. send a password change email from either the Authentication API, login page, or other source.

The following flow chart is a guide to set your tenantâ€™s redirect URI according to its configuration.
