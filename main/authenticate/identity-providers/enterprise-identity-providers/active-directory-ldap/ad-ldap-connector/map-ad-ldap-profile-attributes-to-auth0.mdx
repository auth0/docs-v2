You can modify the mapping of profile attributes from AD/LDAP attributes to attributes in the Auth0 user profile.

1. From a browser, go to `http://localhost:8357` to launch the **Connector Admin Console** on the AD/LDAP Connector server.
2. Click **Profile Mapper** to open a code editor screen which maps attributes from a source directory service (represented by the `raw_data` variable) to a variable that gets returned to populate the Auth0 user profile.
   The first part of the function instantiates a variable called `profile` and has a mapping for the core portion of the Auth0 User Profile. Additional attributes can be set below that using syntax in the form:
   `profile['department'] = raw_data['companydept'];`
   In this example, `department` is the name of the attribute in the Auth0 user profile and `companydept` is the name of the attribute in the source directory service (such as AD).
3. Click **Save** when you are done modifying the LDAP configuration.
4. After the Connector runs the tests, ensure that all the tests are green.
