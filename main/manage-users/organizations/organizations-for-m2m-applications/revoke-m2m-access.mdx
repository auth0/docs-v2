To revoke M2M access, or remove access to an organization for your application, you must delete the association between its client grant(s) and the organization. Once this association is deleted, the application will no longer be permitted to use the organization when requesting new tokens for the API defined in the grant.

Revoking M2M access does not impact applications that have been granted access to any organization. To learn more, read [Define Organization Behavior](/manage-users/organizations/organizations-for-m2m-applications/configure-your-application-for-m2m-access#define-organization-behavior).
