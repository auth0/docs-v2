The core Authorization features of Auth0 allow for role-based access control (RBAC) of your APIs.

For RBAC to work properly, you must enable it for your API using either the Dashboard or the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>. To learn more, read [Enable Role-Based Access Control for APIs](/get-started/apis/enable-role-based-access-control-for-apis).

Authorization Core functionality is different from the Authorization Extension. For a comparison between the two products, read [Authorization Core vs. Authorization Extension](/manage-users/access-control/authorization-core-vs-authorization-extension).

To use the core functionality most efficiently, you should do the following:

1. [Register API with Auth0](/get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis)
2. [Define permissions for API](/get-started/apis/add-api-permissions)
3. [Create roles](/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/roles/create-roles)
4. [Assign roles to users](/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/rbac-users/assign-roles-to-users)
5. [Assign permissions to users](/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/rbac-users/assign-permissions-to-users), if needed.
