You can view the users assigned to a [role](/manage-users/access-control/rbac) using the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> or the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>. Roles are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

## Prerequisites

For role-based access control (RBAC) to work properly, you must enable it for your API using either the Dashboard or the Management API. The Authorization Core functionality is different from the Authorization Extension. For a comparison, read [Authorization Core vs. Authorization Extension](/manage-users/access-control/authorization-core-vs-authorization-extension).

## Dashboard

1. Go to [Dashboard > User Management > Roles](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users) and click the name of the role to view.
2. Click the **Users** tab.

The following information is displayed for each user:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Picture | User's picture from the user profile. |
| Name | User's name from the user profile. |
| Email address | User's email address from the user profile. |

## Management API

To retrieve a list of users assigned to a role, see [Get a Role's Users](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Roles/get_role_user).
